# Dancing Signs

What am I but a signpost  
left here at these right-angled paths  
to point all ways, always;   
there is no way, but this.  
  
Full of nothing which men divide  
by knowing they wish to walk  
this way or that, preferring up or down  
after missing the emerald tablet  
at the entrance:  
below and above the same thing,  
no thing at all.  
  
And so I stand, rooted to this earth,  
having travelled far enough to find  
I cannot make a true measure  
of the distance from here to there  
and yet remain, somehow, forgiven.

Each sign carefully painted,  
pointing at this tree, that apple,  
this cup of tea, those mountains:  
meant for climbing, eating,  
drinking, seeing,  
no more, know less:  
  
all of life a lesson  
in how to listen  
and, having heard,  
the signpost sways,  
remembering what it  
feels like to dance again.
