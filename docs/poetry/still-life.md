# Still Life

To live slow enough to hear the sun,  
watch its symbols slide across your bedroom  
on a lazy afternoon spent seeing  
shadows rise and fall over sheets,  
no music this, but something else  
more steady, more staid, and ancient  
as if there were ways to know an afternoon  
deep in your gently warming bones:  
another breakthrough to the peace  
of slow things, like gravity and grasshoppers  
and the pot of wilting flowers you stumbled on  
in a graveyard where you knew yourself, finally,  
to be loved and to love in a language a lot like the sunâ€™s,  
made of shadow words and heat and patience  
all pointing at a peace past understanding.
