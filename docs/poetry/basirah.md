# Basirah

Two butterflies fly together,  
yellow white filtered sunlight,  
until the breathless top is reached  
where they merge and fall  
in what can only be bliss,   
back toward the treetops.   
  
The Book lies open before us,   
and now we can't tell  
which is more beautiful:  
all of it simply reflecting  
perpetual perfection.
