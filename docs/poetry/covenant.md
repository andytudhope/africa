# The Covenant

We finally found it, oldest friend:  
this moment beneath black and white  
where the eyelight between us  
made room for your command  
to let go my greatest crutch and come back  
to the covenant we made before  
conditions were placed on consciousness.  
  
I can't promise I will always trick my devil  
out his many temptations and traps,  
though I will offer him my thanks  
every time he trips me up and,  
as for the rest,  
I swear now, here, on your balcony  
(which has always been my bridging place)  
that I will join forever the chorus singing  
  
فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  
  
For there is nothing left to deny,  
neither my heresy nor the help that is  
offered still, so deep that death itself  
cannot match its majesty.
