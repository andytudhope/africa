title: Falcon Heavy

description: A poem written to commemorate the moment a car with a dummy astronaut was launched into space on a resuable rocket, and the soaring of a certain klind of dream.

# Falcon Heavy

There’s jazz going on  
heard only by our shared  
and secret skin,  
laughing at the silliness  
of all this hide and seek,  
and so many stuck still  
in the first act,  
like asking which star  
is the middle.  
  
Meanwhile they are all  
a centre,  
and you still have the next part  
to play,  
“Don’t Panic” printed  
on a screen sent soaring  
somewhere north of dreams,  
manifesting a music in the way  
“Made By Humans On Earth”  
is burned onto the motherboard.  
  
The biggest practical joke  
a universe ever played on itself.
