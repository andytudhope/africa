# Divan Laughter

_A small selection of the ocean that is the **Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi**_

Translations are by Shahriar Shahriari, though a more scholastic approach by R. A. Nicholson can be found <a href="https://archive.org/details/SelectedPoemsFromTheDivaniShamsiTabriz-ReynoldA.Nicholson/page/n3/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. While Nicholson appeals more to me, Shahriari's simplicity is better suited to this particular page. As Nicholson himself says:

> Sufism has few ideas, but an inexhaustible wealth and variety of illustration. Among a thousand fluttering masks the interpreter is required to identify each old familiar face. 

However, Nicholson is wrong in his charge of pantheism because, like most of us, he overcomplicates things. It is very simple: _Lā ilāha illa'Llāh Muḥammadun rasūlu -llāhi_. He is closer to the mark when he says:

> All religions and revelations are only the rays of a single eternal Sun; all Prophets have only delivered and proclaimed in different tongues the same principles of eternal goodness and eternal truth which flow from the divine Soul of the world.

It is time, then, to turn that lone Voice:

_Silence I choose, best Thou givest the news_  
_Thou art the reason for which I speak and sing._

I went on a journey without me  
There I found joy without me.  
  
For Beloved, the you in you is disguise   
To focus on the you in you is unwise.   
To you, phoenix, demise is mere lies   
Phoenix running from fire is unwise.  
  
Headless, footless, indeed, without retinue I lead  
In my own sweet land, sweetness to myself feed.   
We know of nothing other than burning up, candle-like.  
  
I am in desperate awe, why was I ever created?  
  
Lost in the desert, you are seeking and you fall;  
If that lovely faceless face you once see   
Pilgrim and shrine and house you know are all thee.  
  
I am in love, to the depths of love descend.   
Run away to what avail, deathward bound   
Why hide, a thousand times sought me and found.  
  
If graced with Beloved’s affection   
Like a mirror become reflection.  
  
With His love I am raw   
I am confused and in awe  
The ocean of loving grace   
Traces the lover’s face.  
  
The pearl that outgrows both worlds   
Within the sea of my heart shall drown.  
  
Every place I looked, looked great   
Saw my beloved, my soul mate.  
  
Instead of the heavens and the world  
In the pastures of Divine Union we blend.  
  
Those who land in the state of singular intelligence  
No longer place the other on a separate page.  
  
It is hidden and obscure, it is an obvious sign.  
Each breath is a song of love.  
  
O sweet singer of love  
Tell us the secrets of love   
Ecstatic music from above  
Is our quest tonight.  
  
When the moon was shining its light   
Both worlds were gardens of delight   
All souls for home then took flight   
And so we say, may it be so.  
  
I am of Thee O famed moon,   
Gazing at me do not swoon   
Contagious joy in me bloom       
Laughs my every petal.  
  
The fragrant morning breeze brings news of union       
With joy and with song I’ll leave this cage, this earthly throne.  
  
This day, own senses, hour and time cannot fit   
This day, afire, passionately we are lit   
This day, this joyous feast, joy shall never quit.  
  
In the divine light, a speck of dust   
Joyously dances, without need or lust.  
  
I eliminated duality with joyous laughter   
Saw the unity of here and the hereafter   
Unity is what I sing, unity is what I speak   
Unity is what I know, unity is what I seek.  
  
Praise divine revelation  
Praise soul’s coronation.  
  
The House of God is the abode of the heart  
Blessed are those whom to the heart made their pledge;  
Whoever found a glimpse of that House in this  
Not even in the heavens would seek tutelage.  
The tribe that found God only in a friend,  
They are the keys to that House, upon the ledge.  
Hope and compassion reside in the Real House  
Those who turned to love, found their wage.  
  
Thy light is Light Divine  
Distinct, yet connecting all.  
O heart let go of your soul   
Until you see the soul maker.  
  
Heart trickster, soul veil and mind bind   
To find the path you must put all three behind.   
When you transcend heart and soul as well as mind   
It is like giving sight to the blind.   
  
Anything but Love upon this path is idolatry.  
Whoever sees but the Beloved, sees astray,  
Drink of the spirit of Love, the sole elixir in history.  
  
For love put your life on the line   
Align yourself with the Divine.  
  
Lovers their wine draw   
From cup of skull with bone straw   
In such a feast obey the law           
Yourself efface, yourself efface. 
  
You who seek God apart, apart,   
The thing you seek, thou art, thou art;  
Thou art the letters, names and the book   
Prophets and angels your word undertook;   
Just sit still, this futile search let go   
You are the house, master and foe.  
Essence and form, celestial and from earth   
Always eternal, in death and at birth.   
  
I was dead, became alive   
Was tearful, laughingly thrive   
With love survive, my only drive       
I have become eternal.  
[...]  
"Thou art not yet slain   
Joy runs not in thy vein."   
Before life now I remain       
Slain, sacrificed and small.  
  
I am the prayer and the angel in flight   
I am the fire, I am the light   
I am the Promised Land, so dear, so dear.  
I am here, I am to be   
Alpha and Omega are in me   
I am aware of the others, keep near, keep near.  
I am the acquaintance and the friend   
The lover and beloved in the end   
I am the flower and the thorn, don’t fear, don’t fear.  
I am the season and temporal train   
I am the minor, I am the main   
I am the mind and the story, be here, be here.  
  
My place is the no-place  
My image is without face   
Neither of body nor the soul   
I am of the Divine Whole.
