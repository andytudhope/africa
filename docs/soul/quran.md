# True Victory

All my time spent,  
no time at all lost,  
in singularity:  
  
this many-folded matrix,  
clear manifest   
of every message.  
  
What touched one heart  
is traced here.  
If it turns you  
  
read the whole book  
yourself.  
You have been warned.  
  
All this really is:  
a record of my flaws,  
for which I am responsible.

_Visankharagatam cittam_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone to dissolution is the mind,  
_Tanhanam khayam ajjhaga_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cravings have come to an end.  

Please complete _wudu_ before reading this. Alternatively, stop here, close your eyes and focus on your breath. Allow yourself to sink into the silence between each impulse. Let your attention return to its seat in your heart.

One word about the name "Allah". _Al_ is the definite article in Arabic, meaning 'the'. _Lah_ is senseless: it has no meaning. It is, in some fundamental manner, the empty-form-formless-emptiness found in the heart Sutra; the word that is God in the Gospel of John; the being that appears to the gods in the Kena Upanishad, whom Uma - Divine Wisdom - calls "tadvanam". When we say "Allahu akhbar", we are saying "God is **greater**". Not great (a thing) or greatest (a degree of comparison), but great*er*. Always greater than anything you can think or imagine; neither empty nor formless (nor both, nor neither); a word without tense that is the source of time; that which is adored above any thing and annihilates the longing of true love.

This is not to elide the important historical distinctions between these traditions, to obscure the differences in their practice, or to ignore the impact (positive and negative) they continue to have on people. That said, and as [Sri Krishna Prem writes](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.188686) about the simple path by which we unify our finitude with Infinite Being:

> "It is not so much a synthesis of these separate teachings as that prior and undivided whole of which they represent partial formulations."

## Declaration

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/44">40:44</a><br/>
"You will soon remember what I say (now), my (own) affair I commit to Allah: for Allah (ever) watches over His Servants." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/84">3:84</a><br/>
Say: "We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord—we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we fully submit." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/105">21:105</a><br/>
Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message (given to Moses): “My servants, the righteous, shall inherit the earth.” 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/93">21:93</a> (see also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/23/52-53">23:52-3</a>)<br/>
But (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another: (yet) they will all return to Us. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/155-156">6:155-6</a><br/>
And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that you may receive mercy:<br/>
Lest you should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/26/192-193">26:192-3</a><br/>
Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds:<br/>
With it came down the spirit of Faith and Truth- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/56/80-81">56:80-1</a><br/>
A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.<br/>
Is it such a Message that you would hold in light esteem? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/126">3:126</a><br/>
Allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted, the Wise:
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/73/5">73:5</a><br/>
Surely We will make to light upon you a weighty Word. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/86/13">86:13</a><br/>
Behold this is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil): 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/16">50:16</a><br/>
It was We Who created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/51/5">51:5</a><br/>
Verily that which you are promised is true; 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/60">3:60</a><br/>
The Truth (comes) from Allah alone; so be not of those who doubt. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/36">10:36</a><br/>
But most of them follow nothing but fancy: truly fancy can be of no avail against truth. Verily Allah is well aware of all that they do. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/53">10:53</a><br/>
They seek to be informed by you: "Is that true?" Say: "Yes! by my Lord! it is the very truth! and you cannot frustrate it!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/15/64">15:64</a><br/>
"We have brought to you that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tell the truth. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/45/29">45:29</a><br/> 
"This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on Record all that you did." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/8/8">8:8</a><br/>
That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/3">3:3</a><br/>
He has revealed to thee the Book in truth, confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/7">3:7</a><br/>
He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. Those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord." None will grasp the Message except men of understanding.<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/137">3:137</a><br/>
Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/41/53">41:53</a><br/>
Soon will We show them our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord is a witness of all things? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theholyquran.org/?x=s_main&y=s_middle&kid=15&sid=55">55:13</a>, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77 (see also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/53/55">53:55</a>)<br/>
Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny?
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/31/22">31:22</a><br/>
Whoever submits his whole self to Allah, and is a doer of good, has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with Allah rests the End and Decision of (all) affairs. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/17/81">7:81</a><br/>
And say: "Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish." 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/118">7:118</a><br/>
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/256">2:256</a><br/>
Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/26">4:26</a><br/>
It is Allah’s Will to make things clear to you, guide you to the noble ways of those before you, and turn to you in mercy. For Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/174">4:174</a><br/>
O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: for We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/54/17">54:17</a>, 22, 32, 40<br/>
And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/24/18">24:18</a><br/>
And Allah makes the Signs plain to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/31/30">31:30</a><br/>
That is because Allah is the (only) Reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because Allah,- He is the Most High, Most Great. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/22/62">22:62</a><br/>
That is because Allah - He is the Reality; and those besides Him whom they invoke,- they are but vain Falsehood: verily Allah is He, Most High, Most Great. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/16/22">16:22</a><br/>
Your Allah is one Allah: as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/30">21:30</a><br/>
Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/15/85">15:85</a><br/>
We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. And the Hour is surely coming (when this will be manifest). So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/59">44:59</a><br/>
The Hour will certainly come: Therein is no doubt: Yet most men believe not. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/67/25-26">67:25-6</a><br/>
They ask: When will this promise be (fulfilled)? - If you are telling the truth. 
Say: "As to the knowledge of the time, it is with Allah alone: I am (sent) only to warn plainly in public."
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/70/6-7">70:6-7</a><br/>
They see the (Day) indeed as a far-off (event):<br/>
But We see it (quite) near.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/67">6:67</a><br/>
For every message is a limit of time, and soon shall you know it. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21">21:1</a><br/>
Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning: yet they heed not and they turn away. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/31/28">31:28</a><br/>
And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for Allah is He Who hears and sees (all things). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/56/62">56:62</a><br/>
And you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember? 
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Always You

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/45/15">45:15</a><br/>
Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against himself. In the end, you shall be brought back to your Lord.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/7">7:7</a><br/>
Then We will give them a full account with sure knowledge—for We were never absent. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/46">20:46</a><br/>
He said: "Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see (everything). 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/41">20:41</a><br/>
"And I have prepared thee for Myself (for service)"
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/84/6">84:6</a><br/>
O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling,- but thou shalt meet Him. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/6">29:6</a><br/>
And if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for Allah is free of all needs from all creation. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/14/34">14:34</a><br/>
And He giveth you all that you ask for. But if you count the favours of Allah, never will you be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/53/36-39">53:36-9</a><br/>
Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses-<br/> 
And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-<br/>
Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another;<br/>
That man can have nothing but what he strives for; 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/30/44">30:44</a><br/>
Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will spread their couch (of repose) for themselves (in heaven): 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/23/62">23:62</a><br/>
On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear: before Us is a record which clearly shows the truth: they will never be wronged. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/44">10:44</a><br/>
Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: It is man that wrongs his own soul. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/8/53">8:53</a><br/>
"Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things)." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/54/52-53">54:52-3</a> (see also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/38">6:38</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/59">6:59</a>)<br/>
All that they do is noted in (their) Books (of Deeds):<br/> 
Every matter, small and great, is on record.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/17/14">17:14</a><br/>
Read your Book. Let your own self suffice you now as accountant.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/22/77">22:77</a><br/>
O you who believe! bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your Lord; and do good; that you may prosper.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/206">7:206</a><br/>
Those who are near to thy Lord, disdain not to do Him worship: They celebrate His praises, and prostrate before Him. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/31/33">31:33</a><br/>
O mankind! do your duty to your Lord, and fear (the coming of) a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father. Verily, the promise of Allah is true: let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/49">39:49</a><br/>
Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us: But when We bestow a favour upon him as from Ourselves, he says, "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge (I have)!" Nay, this is a trial, but most of them understand not!<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/70">39:70</a><br/>
And to every soul will be paid in full (the fruit) of its Deeds; and (Allah) knoweth best all that they do. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/65/7">65:7</a><br/>
Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. After a difficulty, Allah will soon grant relief. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/42">7:42</a><br/>
But those who believe and work righteousness,- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear,- they will be Companions of the Garden, therein to dwell (for ever). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/138">2:138</a><br/>
This is the natural Way of Allah. And who is better than Allah in ordaining a way? And we worship none but Him. 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/242">2:242</a><br/>
Thus doth Allah Make clear His Signs to you: In order that ye may understand. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/52">7:52</a><br/>
For We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/57/29">57:29</a><br/>
That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over the Grace of Allah, that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand, to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/80/12">80:12</a><br/>
Therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/32">10:32</a><br/>
Such is Allah, your real Cherisher and Sustainer: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? How then are you turned away? 
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Heartfelt Sincerity

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/98/5">98:5</a><br/>
And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allah, offering Him sincere devotion, being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer; and to practise regular charity; and that is the Way Right and Straight. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/92">3:92</a><br/>
By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you give (freely) of that which you love; and whatever you give, truly Allah knows it well. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/37">50:37</a><br/>
Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/2">39:2</a><br/>
Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve Allah, offering Him sincere devotion. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/57">10:57</a><br/>
O mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a Mercy. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/8/10">8:10</a><br/>
Allah made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/33/4">33:4</a><br/>
Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body...
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/225">2:225</a><br/>
Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/48/4">48:4</a><br/>
It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Believers, that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/33">50:33</a><br/>
Who feared (Allah) Most Gracious Unseen, and brought a heart turned in devotion (to Him): 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/26/89">26:89</a><br/>
But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart; 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/35/38">35:38</a><br/>
Verily Allah knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men's) hearts. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/57/23">57:23</a><br/>
We let you know this so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful— 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/73/8-10">73:8-10</a><br/>
But keep in remembrance the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him whole-heartedly.<br/>
(He is) Lord of the East and the West: there is no god but He: take Him therefore for (thy) Disposer of Affairs.<br/>
And have patience with what they say, and leave them with noble (dignity). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29">29:59</a><br/>
Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust in their Lord and Cherisher. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/37/40-41">37:40-1</a><br/>
The sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah,-<br/> 
For them is a Sustenance determined, 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/51/58">51:58</a><br/>
For Allah is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for ever). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/94/5-8">94:5-8</a><br/>
So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief:<br/>
Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.<br/>
So once you have fulfilled your duty, strive in devotion,<br/> 
turning to your Lord alone with hope.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/17/94">17:94</a><br/>
What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has Allah sent a man (like us) to be (His) Messenger?" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/19/47">19:47</a><br/>
Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/79">6:79</a><br/>
"For me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/27">40:27</a><br/>
Moses said: "I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord (for protection) from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!" 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/66">40:66</a><br/>
Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah,- seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow (in Islam) to the Lord of the Worlds." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/27/40">27:40</a><br/>
Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/12/111">12:111</a><br/>
There is, in their stories, instruction for men endowed with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/11/120">11:120</a><br/>
All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it We make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/18/27">18:27</a><br/>
And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/45">29:45</a><br/>
Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And Allah knows the (deeds) that you do.<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/49">29:49</a><br/>
Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/172">7:172</a><br/>
And remember when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. Allah asked, “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” He cautioned, “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’” 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/13/28">13:28</a><br/>
Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/24/37">24:37</a><br/>
By men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the Remembrance of Allah, nor from regular Prayer, nor from the practice of regular Charity: Their (only) fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed (in a world wholly new),- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/19/96">19:96</a><br/>
On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (Allah) Most Gracious bestow love.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/67/13">67:13</a><br/>
And whether you hide your word or publish it, He certainly has (full) knowledge of the secrets of (all) hearts. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/139">3:139</a><br/>
So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For you must gain mastery if you are true in Faith. 
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Mastery

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/67/1">67:1-2</a><br/>
Blessed be He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things hath Power;-<br/>
He Who created Death and Life, that He may try which of you is best in deed: and He is the Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving;- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/12">6:12</a><br/>
Say: "To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To Allah. He hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) Mercy. That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/27/26">27:26</a><br/>
"Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/54/50">54:50</a><br/>
And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/57/3">57:3</a><br/>
He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full knowledge of all things. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/22/6-7">22:6-7</a><br/>
This is so, because Allah is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who has power over all things.<br/>
And verily the Hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about (the fact) that Allah will raise up all who are in the graves. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/111">20:111</a><br/>
(All) faces shall be humbled before (Him) - the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity (on his back). 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/114">20:114</a><br/>
High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur'an before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, "O my Lord! advance me in knowledge." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/15-16">40:15-6</a><br/>
Raised high above ranks (or degrees), (He is) the Lord of the Throne (of Authority): by His Command doth He send the Spirit (of inspiration) to any of His servants He pleases, that it may warn of the Day of Mutual Meeting,-<br/>
The Day whereon they will (all) come forth: not a single thing concerning them is hidden from Allah. “Whose will be the dominion that Day?" That of Allah, the One, the Irresistible! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/15/98-99">15:98-9</a><br/>
Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration. 
And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/56">10:56</a><br/>
It is He Who giveth life and who taketh it, and to Him shall ye all be brought back. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/44">39:44</a><br/>
Say: "To Allah belongs exclusively (the right to grant) intercession: to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: In the End, it is to Him that you shall be brought back." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/62">39:62</a><br/>
Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/126">4:126</a><br/>
But to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that Encompasseth all things. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/30/26">30:26</a><br/>
To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/109">3:109</a><br/>
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back (for decision). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/24/42">24:42</a><br/>
Yea, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah is the final goal (of all). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/284">2:284</a><br/>
To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah calleth you to account for it. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and punisheth whom He pleaseth, for Allah hath power over all things. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/13/39">13:39</a><br/>
Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/37">10:37</a><br/>
This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/85/21-22">85:21-22</a><br/>
In fact, this is a glorious Quran,<br/>
recorded in a Preserved Tablet. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/59/21">59:21</a><br/>
Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, verily, thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allah. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men, that they may reflect. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/27/88">27:88</a><br/>
Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for He is well acquainted with all that you do. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/56/75-76">56:75-6</a><br/>
Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,-<br/>
And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/14/24">14:24</a><br/>
Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable? A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the heavens of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/31/27">31:27</a><br/>
And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean (were ink), with seven oceans behind it to add to its (supply), yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted (in the writing): for Allah is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/102-105">6:102-5</a><br/>
That is Allah, your Lord! there is no god but He, the Creator of all things: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs.<br/>
No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things.<br/>
"Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings."<br/>
Thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say, "Thou hast taught (us) diligently," and that We may make the matter clear to those who know. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/7/204">7:204</a><br/>
When the Qur'an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that you may receive Mercy. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/15/9">15:9</a><br/>
We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/4">50:4</a><br/>
We already know how much of them the earth takes away: With Us is a record guarding (the full account). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/8">20:8</a><br/>
Allah! there is no god but He! To Him belong the most Beautiful Names. 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/20/98">20:98</a><br/>
The god of you all is the One Allah: there is no god but He: all things He comprehends in His knowledge. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/45/20">45:20</a><br/>
These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured Faith. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/42/17">42:17</a><br/>
It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/47">21:47</a><br/>
We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it (to account): and enough are We to take account.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/55/7-8">55:7-8</a><br/>
And the Firmament has He raised high, and He has set up the Balance (of Justice),<br/>
In order that ye may not transgress (due) balance. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/41/43">41:43</a><br/>
Nothing is said to thee that was not said to the messengers before thee: that thy Lord has at His Command (all) forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty.
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/67">39:67</a><br/>
No just estimate have they made of Allah, such as is due to Him: On the Day of Judgment the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand: Glory to Him! High is He above the Partners they attribute to Him! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/62/1">62:1</a><br/>
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth constantly glorifies Allah—the King, the Most Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/51">3:51</a><br/>
"It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.”
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/83">3:83</a><br/>
Do they desire a way other than Allah’s—knowing that all those in the heavens and the earth submit to His Will, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will all be returned? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/52/48">52:48</a><br/>
Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Our eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth, 
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Live In Death

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/30">39:30</a><br/>
Truly thou wilt die (one day), and truly they (too) will die (one day). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/19">29:19</a><br/>
See they not how Allah originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for Allah. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/98">6:98</a><br/>
It is He Who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand. 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/162">6:162</a><br/>
Say: "Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for Allah, the Cherisher of the Worlds:
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/53/25">53:25</a><br/>
It is to Allah that the End and the Beginning (of all things) belong. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/9">3:9</a><br/>
"Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise." 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/145">3:145</a><br/>
Nor can a soul die except by Allah's leave, the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/62/8">62:8</a><br/>
Say: "The Death from which you flee will truly overtake you: then will you be sent back to the Knower of things secret and open: and He will tell you (the truth of) the things that you did!"
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/19">50:19</a><br/>
And the stupor of death will bring Truth (before his eyes): "This was the thing which thou wast trying to escape!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/13">21:13</a><br/>
Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that you may be called to account. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/77/24-26">77:24-6</a><br/>
Ah woe, that Day! to the Rejecters of Truth!<br/>
Have We not made the earth (as a place) to draw together.<br/>
The living and the dead, 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/57">29:57</a><br/> 
Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to Us shall ye be brought back.<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/29/64">29:64</a><br/>
What is the life of this world but amusement and play? but verily the Home in the Hereafter,- that is life indeed, if they but knew. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/39">40:39</a><br/>
"O my people! This life of the present is nothing but (temporary) convenience: It is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last.” 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/185">3:185</a><br/>
Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/30/19">30:19</a><br/>
It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall ye be brought out (from the dead). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/44/8">44:8</a><br/>
There is no god but He: It is He Who gives life and gives death,- The Lord and Cherisher to you and your earliest ancestors. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/24/25">24:25</a><br/>
On that Day Allah will pay them back (all) their just dues, and they will realise that Allah is the (very) Truth, that makes all things manifest.<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/24/41">24:41</a><br/>
Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate, and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread? Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that they do. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/78">4:78</a><br/>
"Wherever you are, death will find you out, even if you are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah"; but if evil, they say, "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/94">6:94</a><br/>
"And behold! you come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: you have left behind you all (the favours) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/16/96">16:96</a><br/>
What is with you must vanish: what is with Allah will endure. And We will certainly bestow, on those who patiently persevere, their reward according to the best of their actions. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/16">10:16</a><br/>
Say: "If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will you not then understand?"<br/> 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/108">10:108</a><br/>
Say: "O people! Now Truth hath reached you from your Lord! those who receive guidance, do so for the good of their own souls; those who stray, do so to their own loss: and I am not (set) over you to arrange your affairs." 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/43">50:43</a><br/>
Verily it is We Who give Life and Death; and to Us is the Final Goal- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/68">40:68</a><br/>
It is He Who gives Life and Death; and when He decides upon an affair, He says to it, "Be", and it is. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/28/88">28:88</a><br/>
And call not, besides Allah, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/9/27">9:27</a><br/>
Again will Allah, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Fulfilment

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/115">6:115</a><br/>
The word of thy Lord finds its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/48">48:1</a><br/>
Verily We have granted thee a manifest Victory: 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/104">21:104</a><br/>
The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/45">6:45</a><br/>
Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/32">50:32</a><br/>
(A voice will say:) "This is what was promised for you,- for every one who turned (to Allah) in sincere repentance, who kept (His Law), 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/17/108">17:108</a><br/>
"And they say: 'Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!'" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/37/180-182">37:180-2</a><br/>
Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they ascribe (to Him)!<br/>
And Peace on the messengers!<br/>
And Praise to Allah, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/2-3">40:2-3</a><br/>
The revelation of this Book is from Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge,-<br/>
Who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is strict in punishment, and hath a long reach (in all things). There is no god but He: to Him is the final goal. 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/65">40:65</a><br/>
He is the Living (One): There is no god but He: Call upon Him, giving Him sincere devotion. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/23">23:1</a><br/>
The believers must (eventually) win through,- 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/110">110:1</a><br/>
When comes the Help of Allah, and Victory,
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/4">10:4</a><br/>
To Him is your return all together. Allah’s promise is always true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/198">3:198</a><br/>
On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. 
<br/><br/> 

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/39/34">39:34</a><br/>
They shall have all that they wish for, in the presence of their Lord: such is the reward of those who do good: 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/2">6:2</a><br/>
He it is Who created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). And there is in His presence another determined term; yet you doubt within yourselves! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/35">50:35</a><br/>
There will be for them therein all that they wish,- and more besides in Our Presence. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/44/5">44:5</a><br/>
By command, from Our Presence. For We (ever) send (revelations), 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/40">4:40</a><br/>
Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/9/22">9:22</a><br/>
They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in Allah's presence is a reward, the greatest (of all). <br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/9/111">9:111</a><br/>
Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded: that is the achievement supreme. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/57/12">57:12</a><br/>
One Day shalt thou see the believing men and the believing women- how their Light runs forward before them and by their right hands: (their greeting will be): "Good News for you this Day! Gardens beneath which flow rivers! to dwell therein for aye! This is indeed the highest Achievement!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/13">4:13</a><br/>
Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/37/60">37:60</a><br/>
Verily this is the supreme achievement! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/33/71">33:71</a><br/>
That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He that obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/62">10:62</a><br/>
Behold! verily on the friends of Allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve;<br/> 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/64">10:64</a><br/>
For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present and in the Hereafter; no change can there be in the words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme felicity.
<br/><br/> 

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/48/27">48:27</a><br/>
Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger: you shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what you knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/77/7">77:7</a><br/>
Assuredly, what ye are promised must come to pass. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/4/87">4:87</a><br/>
Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah's? 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/30/6">30:6</a><br/>
(It is) the promise of Allah. Never does Allah depart from His promise: but most men understand not. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/16">16:1</a><br/>
(Inevitable) cometh (to pass) the Command of Allah: seek ye not then to hasten it: Glory to Him, and far is He above having the partners they ascribe unto Him! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/40/55">40:55</a><br/>
Patiently, then, persevere: for the Promise of Allah is true: and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and celebrate the Praises of thy Lord in the evening and in the morning. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/78/4-5">78:4-5</a><br/>
Verily, they shall soon (come to) know!<br/>
Verily, verily they shall soon (come to) know! 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/78/39">78:39</a><br/>
That Day will be the sure Reality: Therefore, whoso will, let him take a (straight) return to his Lord! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/32/7">32:7</a><br/>
He Who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay, 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/69">69:1</a><br/>
The Sure Reality!<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/69/51">69:51</a><br/>
But verily it is Truth of assured certainty. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/51/23">51:23</a><br/>
Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is the very Truth, as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/61">3:61</a><br/>
This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/23/116">23:116</a><br/>
Therefore exalted be Allah, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He, the Lord of the Throne of Honour! 
<br/><br/>
<br/>

## Peace

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/138">3:138</a><br/>
Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah! 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/59/22-24">51:22-24</a><br/>
Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.<br/>
Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him.<br/>
He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, declares His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/56/95-96">56:95-96</a><br/>
Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainty.<br/>
So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/19/93">19:93</a><br/>
Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (Allah) Most Gracious as a servant. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/21/19">21:19</a><br/>
To Him belong all (creatures) in the heavens and on earth: Even those who are in His (very) Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor are they (ever) weary (of His service): 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/2/152">2:152</a><br/>
Then do ye remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and reject not Faith. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/19/36">19:36</a><br/>
Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight. 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/19/40">19:40</a><br/>
It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/70/">70:5</a><br/>
Therefore do thou hold Patience,- a Patience of beautiful (contentment). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/89/27-30">89:27-30</a><br/>
(To the righteous soul will be said:) "O (thou) soul, in (complete) rest and satisfaction!<br/>
"Come back thou to thy Lord,- well pleased (thyself), and well-pleasing unto Him!<br/>
"Enter thou, then, among My devotees!<br/>
"Yea, enter thou My Heaven!
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/41/32">41:32</a><br/>
"A hospitable gift from one Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/10">10:10</a><br/>
(This will be) their cry therein: "Glory to Thee, O Allah!" And "Peace" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: "Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!" 
<br/>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/10/25">10:25</a><br/>
But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace: He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a way that is straight. 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/6/127">6:127</a><br/>
For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised (righteousness). 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/50/34">50:34</a><br/>
"Enter ye therein in Peace and Security; this is a Day of Eternal Life!" 
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/18/3">18:3</a><br/>
Wherein they shall remain for ever:
<br/><br/>

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/56/26">56:26</a><br/>
Only the saying, "Peace! Peace".<br/><br/>
