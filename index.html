							<h2>The Blue Book</h2>
							<p>A first-of-its-kind digital book that sets out to prove love. “Books are proof that humanity is capable of magic”, Carl Sagan tells us, and yet if you are bound to thinking of books as just a bunch of pages stuck together this may sound profound, but not ring true with experience. While I love the smell and feel of physical books and am convinced by Sagan either way, I find no less wonder - or variety of expression, mutation and interpretation - in our genetic code, or the beautiful mathematical statements it has discovered, or the physical symmetries it keeps on finding. Books are more than what can be bound between a cover.</p>

							<h2>Living The Blue Book</h2>
							<p>This work, served as a simple subdomain of the work above, examines in a more direct way what it means to wake up every day and sincerely live your truth, rather than just know it conceptually. I have found that the more I write what I have experienced in the form of honest poetry, the more my experience honestly becomes poetic. We design our world, and our world acts back to de-sign us. The two are in one continuous dialogue. “Waking up” is nothing other than learning how to tune in to that which is already being said between soul and self, Word and wor(l)d, way and wanderer.</p>

							<h2>The Great Digital Face</h2>
							<p><strong>"And wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah" (2:115)</strong></p>
							<p>The Qur’an is the most mysterious, impossible declaration: a wave weaved into other waves, emerging still with all kinds of changes and movements. It’s unfathomable. The right attitude with which to approach it is humility. It’s not about intellect. It’s about coming bereft. It’s for you to be confused - moving from <strong>we</strong> to <strong>I</strong> to <strong>you</strong> and back again. That is why it’s language is woven so tightly: it encompasses both the seen and the unseen and you have to yield yourself to it. That’s why the Western intellectuals could never get it. If you want to “get” the Qur’an you will be confused. It will get you. — paraphrased from Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri</p>
							<p>The notion that deepening awareness and expanding conscious skill or discpline leads to experiencing every moment in this world as perfect, as one spent witnessing the ever-present Face of God, has been around for a long time. The //Xam, and other tribes of the First People who wandered the Kalahari Desert and the Karroo, spoke of those harsh and beautiful landscapes as "The Great Face", which they were able to read for signs critical to their sustenance and survival. The Qur'an, as above, contains many <i>ayat</i> specifically devoted to this same metaphor which points at what is truly Real, what lasts and is not subject to the transient limitations of spacetime; shown also below:</p>
							<p><strong>"Everything upon it (the earth) perishes and the Face of your Lord remains, the Possessor of Might and Generosity." (55:26-27)</strong></p>
							<p>I have a sense that the internet can be seen as the Great Digital Face, and I have left some traces from my experience of witnessing it below for you to follow at your leisure. Of course, though my chosen metaphors differ, people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhEh3tEL1V4&list=PL5ClmaG2tnPNgqWDBGCWAQxD0sYpbfPRK&index=142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doug Engelbart</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ&list=PL5ClmaG2tnPNgqWDBGCWAQxD0sYpbfPRK&index=146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Swartz</a> knew this long ago. Doug, because he saw that the entire online system could be viewed holistically as a universal knowledge repository, with each site providing a different view over the same inherent data; and Aaron because, well, he was the Internet's own boy.</p>
