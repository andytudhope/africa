The poem has sparked an almost unique reaction in every different generation of readers who have braved Milton\u2019s grand style and mind-twisting grammar. The obvious example of the same character giving rise to varying interpretations, quite poles apart, is Satan. For Romantic readers like Blake and Shelley, Satan was Milton\u2019s epic hero (intended or not) hence the claim; \u201cMilton\u2019s Devil as a moral being is far superior to his God\u201d (Shelley, 63). The eminent Victorian critic, Sir Walter Raleigh, contends that \u201cSatan unavoidably reminds us of Prometheus\u2026 His very situation as the fearless antagonist of Omnipotence makes him either a fool or a hero and Milton is far from permitting us to think him a fool\u201d (Raleigh, 133). For a modern reader this view has been combated fairly effectively by C.S. Lewis in his A Preface to Paradise Lost, wherein he makes the distinction between believing Satan to be a magnificent poetical achievement worthy of the reader\u2019s admiration and thinking him a magnificent character in and of himself. Satan, for Lewis, \u201cbecomes more a Lie than a Liar; a personified self-contradiction\u201d (Lewis, 94) What is baffling is that two admittedly great literary personages of Lewis and Shelley might arrive at views so incredibly different. Is it possible that Satan was somehow a different character in Blake and Shelley\u2019s time? What is more is that Lewis has by no means won the debate about Satan or the value and greatness of Milton\u2019s poetry with critics of the poem post-1940. A.J. Waldock has this to say: There is hardly a great speech of Satan\u2019s that Milton is not at pains to correct, to damp down and neutralize. He will put some glorious thing in Satan\u2019s mouth, then anxious about the effect of it, will pull us gently by the sleeve (for this is what it amounts to) : \u2018Do not be carried away by this fellow : he sounds splendid, but take my word for it\u2026\u2019 Has there been much despair in what we have been listening to? The speech would almost seem to be incompatible with that. Waldock, 77 We might, at first, be inclined to agree with Waldock if we consider Satan in Book I. He does indeed sound glorious, and Milton does indeed check him just after his speech: Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th\u2019 excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav\u2019n. So spake the Apostate Angel, though in pain Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despair Book I, ll. 123-6 Satan here has elements of Milton\u2019s own utterances in Areopagitica, berating censorship of any kind and championing the individual will, virtuous because \u2018purified\u2019 by trial. The narrative voice at the end does seem contradictory; where in the preceding speech does Satan show any signs of despair? There seems to be even more evidence in Waldock\u2019s favour if we consider the debate in Pand\u00e6monium in Book II where each devil is given his say only to be rebuked by the narrative voice after his speech. Moloch \u201c\u2026 ended frowning, and his look denounc\u2019d/ Desperate revenge\u201d (Book II, 106-7). Belial, whose words are only \u201ccloath\u2019d in reasons garb/ Counsell\u2019d ignoble ease and peaceful sloth/ Not peace\u201d (Book II, 226-8) is veritably taunted by the narrative voice. Mammon receives great applause, but this is only because, for the devils, \u201canother such Field/ They dreaded worse than Hell: so much the fear/ Of thunder and the Sword of Michael/ Wrought still within them\u201d (Book II, 292-5) and Beelzebub can only \u201c[Plead] his devilish Counsel, first devis\u2019d/ By Satan\u201d (Book II, 379-80) even though \u201cSatan except, none higher sat\u201d (Book II, 300). These narrative retorts to some of the most grandiloquent political language in the poem (Book II, 164, 185, 199-225, 230-7, 254, 310-2) and perhaps the entire language, do admittedly seem out of place. However, my argument is that the speech does not \u201cseem\u201d (Waldock, 77) to be incompatible with the narrative rebuke at the end of it; it very much is incompatible with it. Moreover, Milton isn\u2019t pulling \u201cus gently by the sleeve\u201d (Waldock, 77); he is doing exactly what I have suggested \u2013 rebuking us. It is the equivalent of a literary slap in the face. Milton is not politely warning us, but accusing, taunting us with an imperious narrative voice which says \u201cI know that you have already been carried away by what has been said. I knew you would be, even though you should not have been. You have made a mistake because you are fallen.\u201d The invitation is to recognise your fallen nature because this will lead you to a full understanding of Milton\u2019s message at the end of the poem; although fallen, there is nevertheless the possibility of \u201cA paradise within thee, happier farr\u201d (Book XII, 587). Waldock\u2019s insistence that the epic voice and preceding speech \u201cmust agree\u201d (Waldock, 78), stems from a modern preference for showing over telling, illustrated by Wayne C. Booth. This preference is particularly out of place in the epic genre, as this necessarily requires the guiding persona of the poet and his epic voice. The complexity of the devils\u2019 speeches is only apparent when the reader has been led to discovering them by the necessity of having to account for the difference between reading experience and what Milton\u2019s narrative voice is saying. On noticing such complexity, it\u2019s obvious that Milton isn\u2019t correcting a mistake of his own composition, but is pointing to the weakness all men tend to show in the face of demonic eloquence. Waldock is wrong to think that the narrative rebuke somehow scrubs our minds of Satan\u2019s or the devils\u2019 \u201cglorious utterances, heroic demeanour and impressive wilfulness\u201d (Raleigh, 5). In actuality, it sets up a dramatic conflict between the immediate context of what is being said and the larger, cosmic context of the epic situation. It is a conflict analogous to the difference between Satan\u2019s inner despair and outer vainglorious, boastful and arrogant demeanour. However, if we consider this closely, the analogy is inverted, as it is Satan\u2019s inner state which correlates to the larger, cosmic context that Milton was working in. This is not surprising, given Milton\u2019s constant reminders of Hell (and Paradise, as above) as not just physically realisable places, but psychological states of being: The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more than from himself can fly By change of place Book IV, ll. 18-23 It is at this point that Milton begins to \u201cplay\u201d with the reader. I do not mean this in the sense of a child on a playground, but rather in that age-old dictum Milton would have known all too well; docere et delectare. Milton\u2019s poem suggests that our internal state is related to the cosmos, which we can alter according to our free will and through our relationships with others, although God has foreknowledge of all futures and essentially exerts his authority through his mere existence. This is a point I feel Waldock misses entirely; one of Milton\u2019s major concerns is with relationships; how we relate to God, the Son and the Angels (both as fallen and unfallen beings), how we relate to Satan and him to us, how Satan relates to God, how Satan relates to himself, how we relate to Adam and Eve and how the way that they relate to each other sheds light on human relationships in general. It is these relationships Milton uses to delight and teach the reader as he is drawn along by the poet\u2019s unique grammar and epic, grand style. Waldock does not see that these relationships shed light on some of the vital and most engaging speeches in the poem, such as Eve and Adam to each other (Book IX, 205-25, 227-69) and Satan to Eve (Book IX, 679-732). In fact, he misses completely the central relationship Milton is concerned with; that of the poem with the reader. I would argue that the poem\u2019s centre of reference is the reader, as it is to the reader that Milton wants to \u201cjustify the wayes of God\u201d (Book I, 26). More than this though, Paradise Lost is written for \u201cthe honor and instruction of [Milton\u2019s] country\u2026 [For the] adorning of [his] native tongue\u2026 [and] to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest things among mine own citizens\u201d (Milton, \u2018The Reason of Church Government\u2019, emphasis added). In other words, Milton has a specific purpose in writing his epic; he wants to educate his reader into a knowledge and then acceptance of their position and responsibilities as a fallen being. Milton achieves this by recreating the effects of the Fall in the mind of each reader, which is arguably the poem\u2019s final \u2018scene\u2019. We must believe Satan entirely if we are to learn how to see through his lies. If we did not see them as true first (or as holding some truth), we could not realise, and thus overcome, the power of Satanic eloquence; precisely the reason for Eve\u2019s fall \u2013 her being \u201cmindless\u201d (Book IX, 431). The poem\u2019s relationship with the reader goes deeper than this though, for we often forget that the Seventeenth Century reader was a very different man to the modern one. Milton, fortunately, lived on the edge of Douglas Bush\u2019s \u201cscientific movement\u201d (Bush, 37) which divorced cosmic principles from human relationships and interaction. This shattered what E.M.W. Tillyard describes as the \u201cChain of Being\u201d (Tillyard, 37); an object that was thought to both distinguish and unite all modes of existence from rocks, through plants and animals, to humans, angels and God. As such, Milton could make the most of the \u201cmedieval allegorical instinct\u201d, which Bush describes as arising from \u201cthe simultaneous embracing of different planes of knowledge and experience or the habit of immediate and almost unconscious transition from one to another\u201d (Bush, 38). The transition from Satan\u2019s voice to narrative rebuke is perhaps the most prominent example of Milton mixing different cosmic planes of knowledge and experience to induce a specific effect (that of the recognition of one\u2019s own fallen nature) in order to achieve a specific purpose (educate the reader so that he can regain a paradise within himself). Section II The characters of Satan and the devils may be the most widely discussed and criticised of Milton\u2019s attempts to educate the reader while writing a national epic, but they are not his only mechanism. Epic simile is an important part of the epic genre, used specifically in an attempt to place people and things, perceived in one time and place, in the larger perspective from which their significance can be determined. This presents an obvious problem for Milton though, for the story he is telling is not one that exists fully in time and space. We cannot think of God or of the story of creation as happening at a given time or place, as both of these notions are premised on the act of creation itself. Milton\u2019s similes may therefore be seen as a solution to an apparently unsolvable problem; by refusing to allow the reader to perceive a firm notion of time and space initially, Milton can widen the scope of the poem to include the entire cosmos without contradicting himself. Let us consider one of the first epic similes we encounter in the poem: His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast Of some great Admiral, were but a wand Book I, ll. 292-4 If re-read slowly, this does make sense; and we can construct a statement of relative magnitudes; \u201cSpear is to pine as pine is to wand\u201d, but this is not what the reading experience is truly like. Due to Milton\u2019s grammar, this experience tells us is that were one to compare his spear to a pine, the comparison would be inadequate. Milton is mixing scales; if he allowed the association with the pine to stand it would have been inadequate, as Satan is a higher dimensional being, and so his \u2018size\u2019 cannot be understood in human terms. If he had merely said that the spear is larger than one can imagine, he would have lost the concreteness that is vital to any effective image. We cannot simultaneously imagine a pine and a wand while comparing both to a third object, and so Milton is able to suggest a reality beyond our own by forcing the reader, dramatically, to feel its unavailability. Within lines of this, Milton produces what is arguably the finest epic simile in English literature: His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans\u2019t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In Vallombrosa\u2026 Book I, ll. 299-301 Milton moves from \u201cAngel Forms\u201d to leaves to sedge to \u201cBusiris and his Memphian Chivalry\u201d (Book I, 307). The compression of images here is so densely intermingled with different time frames that it almost defies analysis. The fallen angels (who are like Pharaoh and his cavalry in that they are in a lake, beaten by God) are as numberless as autumnal leaves and are scattered (like Pharaoh) as easily as sedge. Both are already pursuing \u201cThe Sojourners of Goshen\u201d (Book I, 309) which can be taken to mean, quite literally, the Israelites \u2013 as well as Adam and Eve \u2013 and hence, by Milton\u2019s interconnected world, the reader. Attempting to unravel a chronological time frame proves impossible; Milton has moved from outside conceptions of time, to recorded human history to the reader\u2019s present and back again in 12 lines of poetry. Furthermore, we are made to feel the shifts inessential, carried along by words like \u201cVallombrosa\u201d, which stress the image above all else. Conceptions of time are shattered by Milton\u2019s style, grammar and palpably aural techniques. One need just roll \u201cVallombrosa\u201d on the tongue to be transported to a paradise where time is truly of no concern. Between these two similes, we find one of Milton\u2019s many references to the \u201cTuscan Artist\u201d (Book I, 288) Galileo Galilei, whose \u201cglazed optic tube\u201d (Book III, 590) could well represent the limits of human knowledge in Milton\u2019s time. However, even the references to astronomers bear great ambiguity. Adam asks Raphael for an explanation of planetary movement in Book VIII, and is replied to thus: \u2026 how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl\u2019d o\u2019re, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb Book VIII, ll. 82-4 The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Book VIII, ll. 129-30 The greatest shock for a modern reader, besides the fact that Milton is mixing two theories about space, is that the speech is finished off with another narrative intrusion: \u201cTo whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli\u2019d\u201d (Book VIII, 179). Cleared of doubt? This seems dubious at best. How is it possible that such a convoluted explanation which mixes two clearly different world-views clears Adam of doubt? What is more is that Milton actually anticipates this reaction in the argument to Book VIII; \u201cAdam enquires concerning celestial Motions, is doubtfully answered\u201d. One answer to this question has already been hinted at in the discussion of Satan above. Only by forcing upon the reader an awareness of his limited perspective can Milton provide a negative intuition of what another perspective may be like. The reasoning may seem circular, but this is a direct consequence of the poem\u2019s subject matter; it is the story of creation and, as such, still creates the responses of its reader and (for Milton) all readers. The fact is that Adam is cleared of doubt only because he is unfallen and thus knows that the knowledge offered to him by Rafael is all that he needs to know; other things remain rightly out of reach of his understanding as a man. By making sure we doubt where Adam does not, Milton makes us aware of the gap between ourselves and Adam. We are made to feel palpably the result of the Fall by the clearly outrageous comment of the narrative voice which is just as clearly true. If we can find our way through this juxtaposition, we can come to fully appreciate Adam\u2019s words in Book XII: Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe. Book XII, ll. 557-90 Milton seems to suggest that there is some knowledge that cannot be contained in earthly vessels, which are bound, by their very nature, to earthly dimensions. Section III Such dimensions include time, which has always been a topic of much debate for scientists and philosophers. Milton unsettles the reading experience with truly epic shifts in time. The most obvious of these is Michael taking Adam on a run through of most of human history in Books XI and XII. However, we are met with discrepancies in time much earlier on, in fact, as early as the first page. We are told that \u201cNine times the Space that measures Day and Night\u201d (Book I, 50) is the distance Satan fell from heaven. While this may be taken from Greek myth, the ambiguity about quite what or who is doing the measuring is clearly Miltonic. Can space measure? If so, how long is a day and is it longer or shorter than a night? Can day and night be spatial at all? Milton, in many ways, was a couple of hundred years ahead of Einstein, for this is surely analogous to the spacetime of Einstein\u2019s General Relativity. Einstein linked space and time through hyperbolic, four dimensional geometry in Minkowski spacetime. Milton\u2019s relativity is, in many ways, far easier to understand than Einstein\u2019s and has one major advantage over it. Milton\u2019s relativity relates all things under the static Chain of Being, which can nevertheless be traversed by the use of free will to move higher up or further down relative to the absolute of God (Tillyard, 45). This fact alone allows Milton to extrapolate relationships between every one of his epic characters and the reader and draw at least some conclusions, through the use of his epic voice, not available to Einstein. One might say Milton\u2019s is a vertical relativity bounded by God while Einstein\u2019s is horizontal and exists only in the limit of human knowledge. Consider the start of Book IX; we begin in an indeterminate time where Milton tells us he \u201cmust change/ Those Notes to Tragic\u201d (Book IX, 6) and justifies why. We then find we are back with Satan (Book IX, 53), circling the Earth \u201cFrom Pole to Pole\u201d (Book IX, 66). We are also back to the end of Book IV, where we left Satan for Raphael and Adam\u2019s visit which lasts the better part of four books. Milton then posits his explanation for our inability to understand God and his Angels in entirely human terms; \u201cThere was a place,/ Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change\u201d (Book IX, 69-70). Note how \u2018Time\u2019, sandwiched in between two caesuras, breaks the flow of the sentence and hence disrupts our understanding of what Milton is saying as we read. Milton is again using his grammar to both play with the reader as well as make a serious point about how our concept of linear, chronological time hampers our understanding of things which necessarily exist outside of conceptual experience. By placing \u2018Sin\u2019 before \u2018Time\u2019 he also makes the reader painfully aware of the very human cause (and thus nature) of this problem. Milton is continually turning the reading experience back on the reader; teaching him while delighting him through an almost numberless array of structural, grammatical, stylistic inversions and twists. These force the reader to acknowledge his fallen nature while making sure that he too comes to the same conclusion as Milton does; there is indeed the possibility of \u201cA paradise within thee, happier farr\u201d (Book XII, 587) to be reached by faith in the redeeming power of the Son. Milton\u2019s epic voice is perhaps more prevalent and demanding than other epic voices, but this should be seen as a result of the specific purpose Milton had in writing a national epic. He never allows the reader to settle in a time or place or to think about extra-dimensional beings in only one way, or through only one image. His use of contradictory images and systems (which are still fundamentally related in the cosmic background of the work) to illustrate and place his poem in time and space, serve to make the scale and scope truly infinite by refusing to fix any one point in absolute relation to any other. As soon as we believe Belial, we are rebuked into remembering that his words are only \u201c\u2026 cloath\u2019d in reasons garb\u201d; as soon as we think we can picture Satan, we are told that what we had in mind is \u201cbut a wand\u201d (Book I, 294) to the actual reality of the \u201cApostate Angel\u201d (Book I, 125). The fallen angels as \u201cAutumnal Leaves\u201d (Book I, 299-311) is probably the most famous example of the sort of intermingled notions of myth, knowledge, time, place and space that constitutes the Miltonic world. Milton, in all his brilliance, is able to structure his very language and form so that any comment on the poem is, through the fundamental relationship of poem to reader, equally a comment on the reader himself.

The narrative voice at the end does seem contradictory; where in the preceding speech does Satan show any signs of despair? There seems to be even more evidence in Waldock\u2019s favour if we consider the debate in Pand\u00e6monium in Book II where each devil is given his say only to be rebuked by the narrative voice after his speech. Moloch \u201c\u2026 ended frowning, and his look denounc\u2019d/ Desperate revenge\u201d (Book II, 106-7). Belial, whose words are only \u201ccloath\u2019d in reasons garb/ Counsell\u2019d ignoble ease and peaceful sloth/ Not peace\u201d (Book II, 226-8) is veritably taunted by the narrative voice. Mammon receives great applause, but this is only because, for the devils, \u201canother such Field/ They dreaded worse than Hell: so much the fear/ Of thunder and the Sword of Michael/ Wrought still within them\u201d (Book II, 292-5) and Beelzebub can only \u201c[Plead] his devilish Counsel, first devis\u2019d/ By Satan\u201d (Book II, 379-80) even though \u201cSatan except, none higher sat\u201d (Book II, 300). These narrative retorts to some of the most grandiloquent political language in the poem (Book II, 164, 185, 199-225, 230-7, 254, 310-2) and perhaps the entire language, do admittedly seem out of place. However, my argument is that the speech does not \u201cseem\u201d (Waldock, 77) to be incompatible with the narrative rebuke at the end of it; it very much is incompatible with it. Moreover, Milton isn\u2019t pulling \u201cus gently by the sleeve\u201d (Waldock, 77); he is doing exactly what I have suggested \u2013 rebuking us. It is the equivalent of a literary slap in the face. Milton is not politely warning us, but accusing, taunting us with an imperious narrative voice which says \u201cI know that you have already been carried away by what has been said. I knew you would be, even though you should not have been. You have made a mistake because you are fallen.\u201d The invitation is to recognise your fallen nature because this will lead you to a full understanding of Milton\u2019s message at the end of the poem; although fallen, there is nevertheless the possibility of \u201cA paradise within thee, happier farr\u201d (Book XII, 587). Waldock\u2019s insistence that the epic voice and preceding speech \u201cmust agree\u201d (Waldock, 78), stems from a modern preference for showing over telling, illustrated by Wayne C. Booth. This preference is particularly out of place in the epic genre, as this necessarily requires the guiding persona of the poet and his epic voice. The complexity of the devils\u2019 speeches is only apparent when the reader has been led to discovering them by the necessity of having to account for the difference between reading experience and what Milton\u2019s narrative voice is saying. On noticing such complexity, it\u2019s obvious that Milton isn\u2019t correcting a mistake of his own composition, but is pointing to the weakness all men tend to show in the face of demonic eloquence. Waldock is wrong to think that the narrative rebuke somehow scrubs our minds of Satan\u2019s or the devils\u2019 \u201cglorious utterances, heroic demeanour and impressive wilfulness\u201d (Raleigh, 5). In actuality, it sets up a dramatic conflict between the immediate context of what is being said and the larger, cosmic context of the epic situation. It is a conflict analogous to the difference between Satan\u2019s inner despair and outer vainglorious, boastful and arrogant demeanour. However, if we consider this closely, the analogy is inverted, as it is Satan\u2019s inner state which correlates to the larger, cosmic context that Milton was working in. This is not surprising, given Milton\u2019s constant reminders of Hell (and Paradise, as above) as not just physically realisable places, but psychological states of being: The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more than from himself can fly By change of place Book IV, ll. 18-23 It is at this point that Milton begins to \u201cplay\u201d with the reader. I do not mean this in the sense of a child on a playground, but rather in that age-old dictum Milton would have known all too well; docere et delectare. Milton\u2019s poem suggests that our internal state is related to the cosmos, which we can alter according to our free will and through our relationships with others, although God has foreknowledge of all futures and essentially exerts his authority through his mere existence. This is a point I feel Waldock misses entirely; one of Milton\u2019s major concerns is with relationships; how we relate to God, the Son and the Angels (both as fallen and unfallen beings), how we relate to Satan and him to us, how Satan relates to God, how Satan relates to himself, how we relate to Adam and Eve and how the way that they relate to each other sheds light on human relationships in general. It is these relationships Milton uses to delight and teach the reader as he is drawn along by the poet\u2019s unique grammar and epic, grand style. Waldock does not see that these relationships shed light on some of the vital and most engaging speeches in the poem, such as Eve and Adam to each other (Book IX, 205-25, 227-69) and Satan to Eve (Book IX, 679-732). In fact, he misses completely the central relationship Milton is concerned with; that of the poem with the reader. I would argue that the poem\u2019s centre of reference is the reader, as it is to the reader that Milton wants to \u201cjustify the wayes of God\u201d (Book I, 26). More than this though, Paradise Lost is written for \u201cthe honor and instruction of [Milton\u2019s] country\u2026 [For the] adorning of [his] native tongue\u2026 [and] to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest things among mine own citizens\u201d (Milton, \u2018The Reason of Church Government\u2019, emphasis added). In other words, Milton has a specific purpose in writing his epic; he wants to educate his reader into a knowledge and then acceptance of their position and responsibilities as a fallen being. Milton achieves this by recreating the effects of the Fall in the mind of each reader, which is arguably the poem\u2019s final \u2018scene\u2019. We must believe Satan entirely if we are to learn how to see through his lies. If we did not see them as true first (or as holding some truth), we could not realise, and thus overcome, the power of Satanic eloquence; precisely the reason for Eve\u2019s fall \u2013 her being \u201cmindless\u201d (Book IX, 431). The poem\u2019s relationship with the reader goes deeper than this though, for we often forget that the Seventeenth Century reader was a very different man to the modern one. Milton, fortunately, lived on the edge of Douglas Bush\u2019s \u201cscientific movement\u201d (Bush, 37) which divorced cosmic principles from human relationships and interaction. This shattered what E.M.W. Tillyard describes as the \u201cChain of Being\u201d (Tillyard, 37); an object that was thought to both distinguish and unite all modes of existence from rocks, through plants and animals, to humans, angels and God. As such, Milton could make the most of the \u201cmedieval allegorical instinct\u201d, which Bush describes as arising from \u201cthe simultaneous embracing of different planes of knowledge and experience or the habit of immediate and almost unconscious transition from one to another\u201d (Bush, 38). The transition from Satan\u2019s voice to narrative rebuke is perhaps the most prominent example of Milton mixing different cosmic planes of knowledge and experience to induce a specific effect (that of the recognition of one\u2019s own fallen nature) in order to achieve a specific purpose (educate the reader so that he can regain a paradise within himself).","title":"Section I"},{"location":"academy/playing-with-time/#section-ii","text":"The characters of Satan and the devils may be the most widely discussed and criticised of Milton\u2019s attempts to educate the reader while writing a national epic, but they are not his only mechanism. Epic simile is an important part of the epic genre, used specifically in an attempt to place people and things, perceived in one time and place, in the larger perspective from which their significance can be determined. This presents an obvious problem for Milton though, for the story he is telling is not one that exists fully in time and space. We cannot think of God or of the story of creation as happening at a given time or place, as both of these notions are premised on the act of creation itself. Milton\u2019s similes may therefore be seen as a solution to an apparently unsolvable problem; by refusing to allow the reader to perceive a firm notion of time and space initially, Milton can widen the scope of the poem to include the entire cosmos without contradicting himself. Let us consider one of the first epic similes we encounter in the poem: His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast Of some great Admiral, were but a wand Book I, ll. 292-4 If re-read slowly, this does make sense; and we can construct a statement of relative magnitudes; \u201cSpear is to pine as pine is to wand\u201d, but this is not what the reading experience is truly like. Due to Milton\u2019s grammar, this experience tells us is that were one to compare his spear to a pine, the comparison would be inadequate. Milton is mixing scales; if he allowed the association with the pine to stand it would have been inadequate, as Satan is a higher dimensional being, and so his \u2018size\u2019 cannot be understood in human terms. If he had merely said that the spear is larger than one can imagine, he would have lost the concreteness that is vital to any effective image. We cannot simultaneously imagine a pine and a wand while comparing both to a third object, and so Milton is able to suggest a reality beyond our own by forcing the reader, dramatically, to feel its unavailability. Within lines of this, Milton produces what is arguably the finest epic simile in English literature: His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans\u2019t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In Vallombrosa\u2026 Book I, ll. 299-301 Milton moves from \u201cAngel Forms\u201d to leaves to sedge to \u201cBusiris and his Memphian Chivalry\u201d (Book I, 307). The compression of images here is so densely intermingled with different time frames that it almost defies analysis. The fallen angels (who are like Pharaoh and his cavalry in that they are in a lake, beaten by God) are as numberless as autumnal leaves and are scattered (like Pharaoh) as easily as sedge. Both are already pursuing \u201cThe Sojourners of Goshen\u201d (Book I, 309) which can be taken to mean, quite literally, the Israelites \u2013 as well as Adam and Eve \u2013 and hence, by Milton\u2019s interconnected world, the reader. Attempting to unravel a chronological time frame proves impossible; Milton has moved from outside conceptions of time, to recorded human history to the reader\u2019s present and back again in 12 lines of poetry. Furthermore, we are made to feel the shifts inessential, carried along by words like \u201cVallombrosa\u201d, which stress the image above all else. Conceptions of time are shattered by Milton\u2019s style, grammar and palpably aural techniques. One need just roll \u201cVallombrosa\u201d on the tongue to be transported to a paradise where time is truly of no concern. Between these two similes, we find one of Milton\u2019s many references to the \u201cTuscan Artist\u201d (Book I, 288) Galileo Galilei, whose \u201cglazed optic tube\u201d (Book III, 590) could well represent the limits of human knowledge in Milton\u2019s time. However, even the references to astronomers bear great ambiguity. Adam asks Raphael for an explanation of planetary movement in Book VIII, and is replied to thus: \u2026 how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl\u2019d o\u2019re, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb Book VIII, ll. 82-4 The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Book VIII, ll. 129-30 The greatest shock for a modern reader, besides the fact that Milton is mixing two theories about space, is that the speech is finished off with another narrative intrusion: \u201cTo whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli\u2019d\u201d (Book VIII, 179). Cleared of doubt? This seems dubious at best. How is it possible that such a convoluted explanation which mixes two clearly different world-views clears Adam of doubt? What is more is that Milton actually anticipates this reaction in the argument to Book VIII; \u201cAdam enquires concerning celestial Motions, is doubtfully answered\u201d. One answer to this question has already been hinted at in the discussion of Satan above. Only by forcing upon the reader an awareness of his limited perspective can Milton provide a negative intuition of what another perspective may be like. The reasoning may seem circular, but this is a direct consequence of the poem\u2019s subject matter; it is the story of creation and, as such, still creates the responses of its reader and (for Milton) all readers. The fact is that Adam is cleared of doubt only because he is unfallen and thus knows that the knowledge offered to him by Rafael is all that he needs to know; other things remain rightly out of reach of his understanding as a man. By making sure we doubt where Adam does not, Milton makes us aware of the gap between ourselves and Adam. We are made to feel palpably the result of the Fall by the clearly outrageous comment of the narrative voice which is just as clearly true. If we can find our way through this juxtaposition, we can come to fully appreciate Adam\u2019s words in Book XII: Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe. Book XII, ll. 557-90 Milton seems to suggest that there is some knowledge that cannot be contained in earthly vessels, which are bound, by their very nature, to earthly dimensions.","title":"Section II"},{"location":"academy/playing-with-time/#section-iii","text":"Such dimensions include time, which has always been a topic of much debate for scientists and philosophers. Milton unsettles the reading experience with truly epic shifts in time. The most obvious of these is Michael taking Adam on a run through of most of human history in Books XI and XII. However, we are met with discrepancies in time much earlier on, in fact, as early as the first page. We are told that \u201cNine times the Space that measures Day and Night\u201d (Book I, 50) is the distance Satan fell from heaven. While this may be taken from Greek myth, the ambiguity about quite what or who is doing the measuring is clearly Miltonic. Can space measure? If so, how long is a day and is it longer or shorter than a night? Can day and night be spatial at all? Milton, in many ways, was a couple of hundred years ahead of Einstein, for this is surely analogous to the spacetime of Einstein\u2019s General Relativity. Einstein linked space and time through hyperbolic, four dimensional geometry in Minkowski spacetime. Milton\u2019s relativity is, in many ways, far easier to understand than Einstein\u2019s and has one major advantage over it. Milton\u2019s relativity relates all things under the static Chain of Being, which can nevertheless be traversed by the use of free will to move higher up or further down relative to the absolute of God (Tillyard, 45). This fact alone allows Milton to extrapolate relationships between every one of his epic characters and the reader and draw at least some conclusions, through the use of his epic voice, not available to Einstein. One might say Milton\u2019s is a vertical relativity bounded by God while Einstein\u2019s is horizontal and exists only in the limit of human knowledge. Consider the start of Book IX; we begin in an indeterminate time where Milton tells us he \u201cmust change/ Those Notes to Tragic\u201d (Book IX, 6) and justifies why. We then find we are back with Satan (Book IX, 53), circling the Earth \u201cFrom Pole to Pole\u201d (Book IX, 66). We are also back to the end of Book IV, where we left Satan for Raphael and Adam\u2019s visit which lasts the better part of four books. Milton then posits his explanation for our inability to understand God and his Angels in entirely human terms; \u201cThere was a place,/ Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change\u201d (Book IX, 69-70). Note how \u2018Time\u2019, sandwiched in between two caesuras, breaks the flow of the sentence and hence disrupts our understanding of what Milton is saying as we read. Milton is again using his grammar to both play with the reader as well as make a serious point about how our concept of linear, chronological time hampers our understanding of things which necessarily exist outside of conceptual experience. By placing \u2018Sin\u2019 before \u2018Time\u2019 he also makes the reader painfully aware of the very human cause (and thus nature) of this problem. Milton is continually turning the reading experience back on the reader; teaching him while delighting him through an almost numberless array of structural, grammatical, stylistic inversions and twists. These force the reader to acknowledge his fallen nature while making sure that he too comes to the same conclusion as Milton does; there is indeed the possibility of \u201cA paradise within thee, happier farr\u201d (Book XII, 587) to be reached by faith in the redeeming power of the Son. Milton\u2019s epic voice is perhaps more prevalent and demanding than other epic voices, but this should be seen as a result of the specific purpose Milton had in writing a national epic. He never allows the reader to settle in a time or place or to think about extra-dimensional beings in only one way, or through only one image. His use of contradictory images and systems (which are still fundamentally related in the cosmic background of the work) to illustrate and place his poem in time and space, serve to make the scale and scope truly infinite by refusing to fix any one point in absolute relation to any other. As soon as we believe Belial, we are rebuked into remembering that his words are only \u201c\u2026 cloath\u2019d in reasons garb\u201d; as soon as we think we can picture Satan, we are told that what we had in mind is \u201cbut a wand\u201d (Book I, 294) to the actual reality of the \u201cApostate Angel\u201d (Book I, 125). The fallen angels as \u201cAutumnal Leaves\u201d (Book I, 299-311) is probably the most famous example of the sort of intermingled notions of myth, knowledge, time, place and space that constitutes the Miltonic world. Milton, in all his brilliance, is able to structure his very language and form so that any comment on the poem is, through the fundamental relationship of poem to reader, equally a comment on the reader himself.","title":"Section III"},{"location":"academy/playing-with-time/#wors-cited","text":"Booth, Wayne C.

However, if \u2013 as Kelly claims \u2013 one can never tell the sincere from the manipulative, then are ways of writing which are advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019 to be read sincerely or suspiciously? If there is no way of separating \u2018truth\u2019 from the performance of truth, then what warrants the description \u2018exemplary and courageous\u2019 and why do critics like Hedley Twidle emphasise the \u201ccurrent success of nonfiction in South Africa\u201d (\u201cIn a Place\u201d, 2012: 6)? Nonfiction makes its primary truth-claims via marketing which places it in a specific, verifiable \u2018reality\u2019. As Salman Rushdie says in his short introductory note: \u201cThe book Rian Malan set out to write is altogether more conventional than the one he has written [\u2026] along the way, he ran into, and faced up to, the truth that is the making of his book [\u2026] that he could only write about the atrocity of South Africa by admitting the atrocity hidden in his own traitorous heart.\u201d In other words, though nonfiction is advertised as being about \u2018reality\u2019, one can only express the \u2018truth\u2019 by performing one\u2019s own role in creating that \u2018truth\u2019. The \u2018reality\u2019 of nonfiction is revealed by showing how the \u2018truth\u2019 depends on the reader\u2019s belief in such admissions of treachery and their awareness of the way \u2018reality\u2019 is inevitably manipulated in order to represent unconventional and traitorous \u2013 yet affective and self-conscious \u2013 \u2018truths\u2019. David Shields argues that the desire to break \u201clarger and larger chunks of \u2018reality\u2019\u201d into artistic works is, in fact, common to \u201ca burgeoning group of interrelated but unconnected artists in a multitude of forms and media\u201d (Reality Hunger, 2010: 3). Shields claims this \u2018reality hunger\u2019 to be present in almost any artistic movement, arguing that modern readers are both \u201cdesperate for authenticity and in love with artifice, they know all the moments are \u2018moments\u2019: staged and theatrical, shaped and thematized\u201d (5). Importantly, Shields\u2019 \u201cantigenre [\u2026] relies on viewer awareness of the creator\u2019s self-conscious, wobbly manipulation of the gap between person and persona\u201d (4). My focus in this essay will therefore be on the ways in which the gaps between person and persona and \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance are manipulated, as well as how \u2013 even as performances \u2013 such manipulative moments might be read sincerely so as to grasp at \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (Midlands, 2002: x), something describable only in terms of Derek Attridge\u2019s concept of \u201cSingularity\u201d (2014). Rian Malan\u2019s My Traitor\u2019s Heart , Antjie Krog\u2019s Country of My Skull (1998), and Jonny Steinberg\u2019s The Number (2004) all rely on similar kinds of self-conscious address and manipulation, beginning with Malan\u2019s very first words: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m burned out and starving to death, so I\u2019m just going to lay this all on you and trust that you\u2019re a visionary reader\u201d (Heart, 13). Each work exhibits what Shields calls \u201cplasticity of form\u201d (Reality, 5), moving between narrative voices and different modes of address to reveal a deep concern with the acts of interpretation, translation, speaking, and listening between black and white, English and Afrikaans, Afrikaans and Zulu, and so on. Self-conscious, if wobbly, manipulation of the gap between person and persona relies on what Adam Kelly calls a \u201clogic of anticipation\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136). He explains that \u201cthe anticipation of others\u2019 reception of one\u2019s outward behaviour [\u2026] begins to take priority for the acting self, so that inner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic\u201d (136). In other words, how we expect others to react becomes the originating cause of how we present ourselves, which can be read either as deeply narcissistic, or as a sincere attempt to engender a different kind of responsibility. It all depends on what the reader chooses to make of the performance. Kelly describes anticipation as that which morphs \u201cdivisions between self and other [\u2026] into conflicts with the self, and a recursive and paranoid cycle of endless anticipation begins, putting in doubt the very referents [\u2026] \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019, \u2018inner\u2019 and outer\u2019\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136). Steinberg\u2019s work, grounded as it is in his methods of ethnographic research, seems most concerned with conflicts between the self and how these relate to an external world shared with others. He returns time and again to the problems of narrating anyone\u2019s story but one\u2019s own: I shut up. The subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the \u2018I\u2019 up. But he had, of course, told the \u2018I\u2019 precisely what every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear. He had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. The victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (The Number, 242) Each sentence adapts the claims of the last, and the shifts from I to \u2018I\u2019, to he and \u2018I\u2019, to he and me, clearly stage the ways in which it is possible to manipulate the gap between person and persona, which Shields claims to be a definitive feature of reality hungry art. Steinberg seems well aware that for a white man to declare he can write a story concerned with the lived experiences of \u2018South Africans\u2019 in general is highly suspicious: \u201cI am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and I am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. I announce up front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 2002: 218). Given that the last sentence takes the form of an announcement, this too can be read as fundamentally performative, but it is a performance which Steinberg insists is based upon research and various \u2018gathered materials\u2019. If we lay aside for a moment the \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 140) which Kelly argues gloss over the \u201ctruly valuable in human life [\u2026] love, trust, faith and responsibility\u201d (135), is it not possible to make performances like this \u2018true\u2019 in so far as the reader believes in them, knowing the writer to be as \u2018anxious\u2019 about such an extension of trust as they are? Furthermore, the fact that Steinberg is designing texts in which the \u2018colour of his skin\u2019, the \u2018failure of his predecessors\u2019 and the fact that he deliberately withholds information, paradoxically, seems to add to the truth-value of the work, means the question becomes not just one of reading sincerely and believing the performance, but how we might actively design the ways we read and write to include \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, rather than hoping for Malan\u2019s \u2018visionary reader\u2019 and reading suspiciously. \u2018Love, trust, faith and responsibility\u2019 seems to be most affectively expressed in the self-conscious manipulation of the gap between person and persona, yet there remains something deeply artificial, something staged, about the ways in which all three writers are able to interact with and interpret the \u201cirreconcilable realities\u201d, or \u201cseparate psychic trenches\u201d (Heart, 412) of South Africa and her people. However, as Shields argues, \u2018reality hungry\u2019 art negotiates paradoxes like this with elements including: \u201cartistic risk, emotional intensity and urgency, reader/viewer participation; [and] an overly literal tone, as if a reporter were viewing a strange culture\u201d (5). When Steinberg announces \u201cup front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 218), this is both to take a big artistic risk, and to engage actively in a dialogue with you, the reader, in something approaching an \u2018overly literal tone\u2019. Moreover, \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019 are not stable within any of the texts I have chosen, so while the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. All three writers are addressed as \u2018you\u2019 at various different stages by both fictional characters (like Professor Kondlo) and \u2018real\u2019 people like Magadien: \u201cI am telling you. I need to be Magadien Wentzel to live a proper life\u201d (The Number, 31) or Creina Alcock: \u201cthe only thing you can do is love\u201d (Heart, 409), which is to collapse both writer and reader into the second person. As Phillip Lopate notes, \u201cthe solution to entrapment in the narcissistic hothouse of self is not to relinquish autobiographical writing, but to expand the self by bringing one\u2019s curiosity to interface with more and more history and the present world\u201d (To Show and Tell, 2013: 10-11). Broadly speaking, autobiography has to do with narratives concerned primarily with the self, told by the self; whereas nonfiction \u2013 in my terms \u2013 has to do with narratives primarily about a wider, shared \u2018reality\u2019 told by a self as an act of collaboration with that \u2018reality\u2019 and the people, objects, and practices of which it is constituted. Steinberg\u2019s work is, again, exemplary in terms of the kinds of collaboration it allows for \u2013 not only between writer, characters (who are also interpreters, translators and contributors) and readers \u2013 but also between the persona \u2018Jonny Steinberg\u2019 and various well-known South African intellectuals and institutions, from Ivan Vladislavi\u0107 to the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, who funded his research for The Number (2004: ix). In a very \u2018real\u2019 and open way, Steinberg designs textual spaces which de-sign him back, so that it is not only about reading sincerely, but creating works (as both writers and readers) in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside in order to express \u2018something more than truthfulness\u2019, something with the same ineffable structure of Attridge\u2019s \u2018singularity\u2019. Anne-Marie Willis concept of \u201contological designing\u201d acknowledges that, while we design our spaces (and here she means literally any self-consciously designed space, be it structural, material, textual or otherwise), \u201cin turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed\u201d (\u201cOntological Designing\u201d, 2006: 80). Therefore, the fact that Malan, Krog, and Steinberg all worked as reporters plays an integral role in the nature and quality of each of their texts. Rian Malan, descended from the first Dutch settlers themselves, worked for a time on \u201cthe crime beat\u201d (Heart, 35), which obliterated his \u201ccertainties\u201d (330) and drove him into exile rather than carry arms for the apartheid government. His fractured experience resulted in an ironic book written and published in English by Vintage, \u201cwhich tells us of the defeat of its authors illusions, his ideals, his sense of courage, his ability to comprehend his fellow South Africans as they danced their death dances\u201d (Salman Rushdie, Introductory Note). Antjie Krog, also Afrikaans, worked as a reporter at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, leading to the skin-scorching Country of My Skull, which she actually wrote in Afrikaans first, although published it in English for reasons I will deal with later. Jonny Steinberg, all of whose books are written and published in English, also worked as a reporter and columnist (some of which is collected into Notes From a Fractured Country (2007)) for a number of publications. Just like Malan before him, he often ventures into some of the most dangerous and dilapidated parts of the country. Rather than irony though, the way he collaborates with both characters and \u2018real\u2019 people \u2013 who are often impossible to distinguish on account of him being open about the fact that he regularly changes names to protect or respect people \u2013 means that uncertainty and a certain kind of fracturing becomes a structural feature of his work. Writing in Afrikaans and publishing in English, or inserting passages which assess the role of the writing \u2018I\u2019, or passages in which writer and reader are collapsed in the second-person address of a character, suggests that the works I have chosen have primarily to do with different kinds of fracture and breaks with representation to get at an ultimately performative array of \u201cturth or trth\u201d (Country, 54). This \u2018truth\u2019, which Krog shows she cannot even type, is unique to each individual, time and experience (apartheid, TRC, postapartheid) and yet also shared in some fundamental, \u201cfolded\u201d, and common experience of what Mark Sanders calls \u201chuman-being\u201d (Complicities, 2002: 89). However, unlike hard news reports, South African nonfiction seems exemplary in that it is not \u2018desperate\u2019 for what Shields calls \u201cauthenticity\u201d (Reality, 5). As Antjie Krog writes: if you believe your own lie \u2013 because as narrators we all give ourselves permission to believe our own versions \u2013 how can it be said that you are being misleading? To what extent can you bring yourself not to know what you know? Eventually it is not the lie that matters, but the mechanism in yourself that allows you to accept distortions. (Country, 133) The use of shifting pronouns is clear here: the second-person address implicates the reader, then the parentheses works to include that reader in a wider circle of narrators, all of whom lie and mislead and accept that their \u2018truths\u2019 will always be in some way distorted. Nonfiction, in Krog\u2019s view, is doomed always to manipulate its \u2018trth\u2019 and so is concerned not with authenticity, but with sincerity; with the ability to believe your own lies and thereby perform the \u2018truth\u2019 \u2013 both while writing, as well as while interpreting/reading/translating that \u2018truth\u2019. Lionel Trilling defined sincerity as \u201ca congruence of avowal and actual feeling\u201d (Sincerity and Authenticity, 2), going on to point out that it has been \u201ca salient, perhaps a definitive, characteristic of Western culture for some four hundred years\u201d(6). Most importantly, sincerity retains a notion of the \u201cperformative, [of its] theatrical origins\u201d (9). David Shields argues that, inundated by such performances, modern readers have become more skeptical than ever \u201cof the desperation of the modernist embrace of art as the only solution, and hyperaware of all artifices of genre and form, [yet] we nevertheless seek new means of creating the real\u201d (24). In order to \u2018create the real\u2019 in a believable fashion, Adam Kelly argues that we need to do away with \u201cthe ideal of authenticity, which conceives truth to the self as an end\u201d, and return to Trilling\u2019s (and Shakespeare\u2019s) formulation of sincerity as an ideal involving \u201ctruth to the self [\u2026 only] as a means of ensuring truth to the other\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 132). He goes on: sincerity places emphasis on intersubjective truth and communication with others, and [with] what Trilling calls the \u2018public end in view\u2019, authenticity conceives truth as something inward, personal, and hidden, the goal primarily of self-expression rather than other-directed communication. (132) In other words, the kinds of \u2018truth\u2019 sincere nonfiction can express are primarily dialogic and affective. Essentially, Kelly is suggesting that we do not need new means of creating the real, merely old ones that have been reinterpreted within a world inundated by other-directed communication. The question becomes one of creating the \u2018real\u2019 in believable ways, which is something Malan, Krog, and Steinberg achieve via different techniques, though I will argue that the collaborative and anticipatory frames within which Steinberg conducts his research and writing are exemplary of a new kind of \u201cOntological Designing\u201d (Anne-Marie Willis, 2006) beginning to take form in the apparent formlessness of Shields\u2019 \u201cantigenre\u201d (Reality, 4). Put differently, sincere writing which anticipates its own ability to manipulate, or marketing that discusses its own narcissism, or \u2018reality\u2019 that shows up its own artifice, are all made meaningful only via a collaborative, dialogic, and informative performance of the \u2018truth\u2019 they are advertised to represent. Antjie Krog insists that she writes \u201cfiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 2005: 106) which is to make a distinction that, as Kelly notes of advertising in general, \u201chighlights the complexity and impurity of all discourse,\u201d that can \u201conly be responded to by acknowledging one\u2019s own implication in [Derrida\u2019s] \u2018general system of writing\u2019\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 139). In that the logic of anticipation \u2013 or the self-conscious manipulation between person and persona \u2013 relies on a response to the other before they have even reacted, performing sincerely and believably requires an assertion of responsibility for one\u2019s audience(s). However, just as \u201ctrue sincerity, if there ever is such a thing, must take place in the aporia between the conditional and the unconditional\u201d (140), true responsibility \u2013 as Mark Sanders notes \u2013 would only be possible before a \u201cmore or less transcendental figure of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 2002: 98), which is none other than the aporia of death: \u201cSizwe looked into Jake\u2019s dying face and saw himself. For a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 30). Negotiating the inability to be responsible before anything but death, which is the only thing that \u2018truly\u2019 dissolves boundaries like the one between Sizwe and Jake (or Sizwe and Steinberg), requires asserting complicity in Sanders\u2019 framework: a certain kind of \u201cfoldedness in human-being\u201d (98). Human-being, the category from which Simon Mpungose is excluded in My Traitor\u2019s Heart (212), does not refer only to the human beings we interact with daily, but the \u201ctotal existential situation of being human in the world\u201d (Complicities, 89); of responding in a singular and idiosyncratic way to the shared experience of \u2018reality\u2019. Importantly though, human-being is not a transcendental point from which to judge truth from ideology; it is rather a \u201cself-conscious placing of the self\u201d (91) within a wider space of reciprocal, translating/translated address. Fact and fiction may be impossible to separate in work like Malan\u2019s, Krog\u2019s, and Steinberg\u2019s, but if we lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion for a moment and interpret and translate their words and works sincerely, new possibilities are created for the expression of the \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, thereby turning narratives primarily about the self (autobiography) into wider narratives about a more generally applicable and historically recognisable \u2018truth\u2019 (nonfiction). Rian Malan and Linguistic Address \u201cWe tell stories not to die of life\u201d (Country of My Skull, 72) My Traitor\u2019s Heart begins with a direct plea from the \u201cburned out and starving\u201d writer to the \u201cvisionary reader\u201d (13). However, Malan often steps away from his narrative and \u2018listens\u2019 to the testimonies and narratives of people like Simon Mpungose (181-205) and Creina Alcock (342-425), becoming the you that they address (409). Adam Kelly argues that any decision regarding the writer\u2019s intention within an anticipatory framework can \u201conly be made by a particular kind of listener\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 141) and I think that Malan\u2019s use of multiple narrative voices is intended to force both himself and the reader to listen closely to what is being said and who is saying it. By the end of the narrative, the writer admits that \u201cI\u2019m so deeply enmeshed in half-truths and fictionalizations of myself that I will never escape until I simply tell the truth. This was not the book I was contracted to write\u201d (410). Fact and fiction are presented as essentially continuous here, and the possibility of \u2018simply telling the truth\u2019 after four hundred and ten pages seems as likely to happen as the expression of true sincerity or responsibility. The wobbly manipulation of person and persona, of the I-who-writes and the I-who-was-contracted-to-write, can be read either as a kind of egoism and self-aggrandisement, or (if such egoism is read as already-anticipated) as a sincere plea to have the reader believe that his desire to \u2018simply tell the truth\u2019 is the real truth \u2013 not facts, not fiction, but the desire to speak your \u2018truth\u2019 and be heard. In other words, the believable performance of the \u2018truth\u2019 requires both readers and writers to lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion and find a way back to \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, together. Emile Benveniste explains that \u201cI use I only when I am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address. It is this condition of dialogue that is constitutive of person, for it implies that reciprocally I becomes you in the address of the one who in turn designates himself as I\u201d (Problems in General Linguistics, 1971: 224-5). Again, the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, though the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. I and you shift, as Benveniste later says, between \u201ca set of empty signs [\u2026] which are filled as the speaker adopts them\u201d (286): \u2018[\u2026] I have noticed there is no fairness on this earth. So, I must die, so that what I dreamed in 1972 be fulfilled. \u2018That is all I wish to say\u2019 Ah, Simon, Simon, in spite of all I know about you, your words still break my heart. Simon was a killer, and yet, as a friend of mine pointed out, his story seemed to unfold like the story of a saint, deeply disturbing in its biblical parallels [\u2026] I heard no hatred or despair in his last words, just clarity, which he seemed to be offering as a man offers a gift \u2013 a gift of understanding, I thought, and a warning [\u2026] As it turned out, I presumed a great deal. (Heart, 204-5) Here, the I starts off as Simon, as he was heard speaking in court, then it shifts to the writer, who addresses Simon directly (in the present tense), and then the I shifts again to a more personal meditation (presumably Malan\u2019s own, in the past tense). Simon is presented in this passage as both a psychopathic killer and a saint, sent to save his people with a hammer and a dream. Neither interpretation is quite right, but nor is either one entirely wrong. Both are unsettled by the shifts in person and tense. Simon\u2019s story, which takes up a large part of the total narrative, begins with near fairy-tale like narration: \u201cNow comes another tale of ordinary life and extraordinary death in my country. Take my hand, and let\u2019s fly like gods to where it happened\u201d (181) and he is introduced first through the eyes of Debbie Good, one of his victims. The I-who-writes ventriloquises her experience of waking up with Simon in her room, using second person narration to chilling effect: You never know when, but you know it\u2019s coming. And then one night you go to bed around ten. You hear the old red setter barking outside [\u2026] All you remember is the split second of terror when you wake up [\u2026] drenched in blood [\u2026] You\u2019re trying to phone the doctor but you can\u2019t remember how to dial. (186) Carrol Clarkson discusses how you, as addressee of a literary work, gains another dimension when a persona within the world of the novel is addressed as \u2018you\u2019: the use of persona address has the unnerving effect of placing the reader simultaneously in the grammatical position of the second and third persons, at once present and absent with respect to a double-directedness and mutually exclusive trajectory of address. (Coetzee\u2019s Countervoices, 2009: 61) Reader and writer slip between the shifting pronouns, but this is exactly what Malan intends, for to have a fixed concept of the reader is, as Clarkson argues, \u201cto ignore the capacity for the invention and freedom of the artwork\u2019s transcendence in the pure potentiality of \u2018You\u2019\u201d (61). The \u2018pure potentiality of you\u2019 is what makes sincerity a two-way phenomenon \u2013 each reader or listener is forced into making a singular and idiosyncratic decision about the intention of dialogic and/or affective modes of address given that the book is advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019. In the context of such \u2018truth\u2019, what is particularly interesting in My Traitor\u2019s Heart is that it is not just Debbie Good\u2019s eyes, but her race, which is ventriloquised: \u201cto understand such things, you must see them in the context of the state of elemental guilt and fear in which white South Africans live\u201d (189). You, the reader of an English book, published internationally \u2013 but written by an Afrikaner with \u201ca sickness of the soul\u201d (412) \u2013 can only understand such things if you attempt to see from the perspective of Debbie Good (all the while noting how this perspective alters and manipulates Simon\u2019s story). When reader, writer and characters start to slip between these shifting you\u2019s, she\u2019s, and I\u2019s in nonfiction specifically, then it is perhaps not quite \u2018pure potentiality\u2019 we should speak of, but a limited potential to experience the \u2018truth\u2019 as it applies to more than just one\u2019s self: though Malan\u2019s work is \u201cfull of bitterness, cynicism, anger and storms, [it is also] a triumphant instance of [\u2026] defeated love\u201d (Salman Rushdie, Introductory Note). Simon\u2019s courtroom testimony, which appears in quotation marks (181-205) is occasionally interrupted by the I-who-writes to provide more information about the people in the gallery, or the finer points of Zulu metaphor. This may seem problematic \u2013 what gives Malan the right to interpret when the court obviously could not? \u2013 but the writer is also quick to note the fact that \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s words defeated the interpreter\u201d (202). Once again, we are given the opportunity to read the interpretations as manipulative or as springing from the writer\u2019s self-aware sense of defeated love. Simon\u2019s smile vanishes, he sobs, \u201cand then he was suddenly bellowing and howling, like a man in unendurable pain. It was a harrowing sound, the sound of a bull with a sword in its heart\u201d (202). Mark Sanders makes the point that standing in for the other is both a basic expression of human foldedness, and, as it always is, a taking of the place of the other by a particular other, which is what necessitates the constant negotiation of who speaks for whom [\u2026] Folded into any act of representation or advocacy is an other-intendedness that makes it possible at once to portray and betray. (Complicities, 207) Malan\u2019s interruptions and interpretations, sincerely read, are both a basic expression of a kind of foldedness with Simon made profound only because it is advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019 and, inevitably, a betrayal in the sense that Simon is, once more, reduced to a largely English, largely white audience. Attempting to negotiate portrayal and betrayal, as well as the pitfalls of interpretation and (translated, legal) representation, Malan travels to Empangeni \u2013 where Simon was born \u2013 to try and understand more of the \u2018truth\u2019 about the Hammerman. He discovers the story of a boy cast out from society on account of the incest committed by his grandparents, spoken of as if he were the \u201cliving dead, as one who \u201cnever became human\u201d (Heart, 207). Sanders argues that \u201cone\u2019s human-being depends on a relation to an other and thus involves an affectual and ethical dimension, which, as Fanon notes, can be actualized or destroyed in the structure of linguistic address\u201d (Complicities, 183). To understand why one might be excluded from such human-being for the sins of one\u2019s forebears, Malan starts Simon\u2019s story over again, \u201cfrom the very beginning, as all stories must be told\u201d (Heart, 209), requiring that \u201cwe talk of the ancestors\u201d (212). They \u201care that close, that omnipresent\u201d (212). In Simon\u2019s culture, the ancestors are quite literal, experienced, and immanent embodiments of Sanders\u2019 \u201cmore or less transcendental figure[s] of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 98) required to negotiate the aporia inherent in the structure of true responsibility. In this sense, they (also quite literally) regulate entry into the category \u2018human-being\u2019, preventing people like Simon \u2013 who is an \u201cabomination\u201d (211) due to his incestuous grandparents \u2013 from attaining full personhood. After meeting various members of Simon\u2019s family, Malan asks: \u201cSo what was the truth of Simon?\u201d (222), eventually conceding that These were facts, not myths, although what freight they carried I could not say. I was deaf in Simon\u2019s language, and blind in his culture. In the end, all I really understood of Simon was that terrible scream [\u2026] I understood it because it was couched in the universal language of human pain. (224) Though he cannot understand what is at stake in such facts, the \u2018universal language of pain\u2019 Malan identifies is also alluded to by Antjie Krog, who would make Nomonde Calata\u2019s tears into the \u201csignature cry\u201d (Country, 43) of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998. Carli Coetzee, amongst many others, has noted the problems inherent in such universalising claims, arguing (quite validly) that they turn the body, specifically bodies like those of Nomonde Calata, into \u201ca cathartic symbol of a supposedly national myth\u201d, which constitutes more of a betrayal than a portrayal (\u201cThey Never Wept\u201d, 2000: 5). In the same way, using a real person like Simon Mpungose\u2019s story as a means to anything, no matter how valuable it may seem, will always imply a strong element of betrayal. There is, in a sense, no answer to this conundrum other than to point out, again, that it is the possibility of manipulation or betrayal which makes concepts like sincerity meaningful, responsible and response-able. As Adam Kelly explains, \u201cthe two poles become interminably entangled in any action, and we can never know for certain [\u2026] if any single event of giving or receiving is the genuine article or not\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 139). Even if Malan and his readers are deaf in Simon\u2019s language and cannot tell apart the poles of betrayal and portrayal, or truth and its performance; there is still a lesson to be learnt, a lesson that can be learnt: \u201cin [South Africa], white men assumed that they were the centre of the black universe \u2013 that they had subjugated the dreams and psyches of Africans, along with their bodies. It simply wasn\u2019t true. That is what Simon taught me\u201d (Heart, 235). It is a deeply profound lesson to learn, especially in the late 1980\u2019s, when South Africa was at its most violent and murderous. Moreover, the end of Malan\u2019s book in fact overturns exactly the white man\u2019s assumption, as Neil Alcock ascends (via a spirit stick) into the realm of death \u2013 and the immanent ancestors \u2013 hopefully to guide his people back home to a place where they can assert responsibility and foldedness in human-being: \u2018Neil, he was same like a black man. The skin was white, but the heart it was same like a black\u2019 [\u2026] They stood over the spot where their white brother was slain, and invited his spirit to enter their sacred stick. \u2018Numzaan,\u2019 they said, \u2018we have come to fetch you. Come, let us go home\u2019 [\u2026] The horns were a reminder of the ceremony performed that day, a sign that the household within had honoured its shades [\u2026] Aeons after our ancestors walked away, the first white man had come home to stay. (424-5) These final words carry a strong sense of the performative, mimicking the ceremony that has been carried out to cleanse and honour Neil\u2019s house \u2013 a symbol of how he and Creina are \u201cthe only white people who lived beyond all suspicion of complicity\u201d (342) \u2013 and yet they return Neil (via a textual staging) to his place amongst the immanent ancestors who are honoured on a day-to-day basis in acts intended to advance the truly valuable in human life, like love, trust, faith, and responsibility. To me, that is enough to risk betrayal and encourage sincere writing, reading, and listening once more. Country of My Skull, Translation and Singularity \u201cIt is language that shoots up like fire \u2013 wrought from a vision of where we must go and from a grip on where we are now\u201d (Country of My Skull, 230-1) Of all three writers I have chosen, Kelly\u2019s \u2018logic of anticipation\u2019 applies most directly to Antjie Krog and, more specifically, to her language(s) in that her work is premised on different kinds of translations: between languages, between races, and between generations. She confirmed, via email, that Country of My Skull (1998) [\u2026] was first written in Afrikaans and then translated by my son. I gave the first chapter to somebody with mothertongue english but found the text then too english to enter or change or own. it felt foreign. my son\u2019s text kept its Afrikaans underground and could be worked on. my engels was te swak om country te vertaal daardie tyd, so ook change of tongue. Begging is ook in Afrikaans geskryf maar my Engels is nou goed genoeg om nie-fiksie te vertaal. (ek dink). \u201cMy English was too weak to translate Country at the time [1997-8], as was the case with Change of Tongue [2003]. Begging [to be Black (2009)] was also written in Afrikaans, but my English is now good enough to translate nonfiction. (I think)\u201d. (Translation my own. 6 May 2015) Even casual communication is (at least) bilingual for Krog, though her admission that her English is weak is interesting given that Derek Attridge notes how \u201cmost Afrikaans writers have an excellent grasp of [English]\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 15). Krog\u2019s active (mis)use of languages, combined with her insistence that she \u201cwrites fiction bordering on fact while marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 2006: 106) results only in more questions. Why is nonfiction (especially work like hers, which uses poetry and \u2018fictional elements\u2019) easier to translate than fiction or poetry; does \u2018English that keeps its Afrikaans underground\u2019 suppress the original language or use it as a foundation; and how are we to understand any of her claims in the light of Kate Highman\u2019s revelations about the extent of \u201cplagiarism\u201d and \u201cventriloquism\u201d in Country (\u201cForging\u201d, 2015: 188)? And, if reading sincerely is a case of eliding the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance, does \u2018plagiarism\u2019 really amount to misuse? Starting with the second question, the word for \u2018keep to\u2019 in Afrikaans (in the sense of biblical commandments) is \u2018onderhoud\u2019 \u2013 which sounds very similar to \u2018underground\u2019 and is what I think Krog means in her email: her son\u2019s translation kept its Afrikaans grounding, hence she could work it over herself before publishing in English. In other words, the feeling of an other language (Afrikaans) at work beneath Country at once grounds the text and undermines it in the sense that something is always, as Attridge says, \u201clost in translation\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 17). Moreover, when switching between languages or highlighting (for instance) that she can only ever write the \u201ctrth or turth\u201d (Country, 54) Krog seems \u2013 if anything \u2013 actively to encourage singular readings which are as sincere, anticipatory and performative as the claim that the writer cannot actually write \u2018truth\u2019 in a nonfiction text. \u201cSingularity is not universal or transcendent,\u201d Derek Attridge explains, but it is what \u201cthe artist, often without being fully aware of how it is happening, is able to apprehend and articulate by reforming and revising the forces that are excluding it\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 10). Unfortunately, some of Krog\u2019s revisions seem to take on their own exclusionary nature (see the adapted testimony of Johannes Lekotse and Highman\u2019s analysis of it (\u201cForging\u201d, 198)), but she is able to apprehend and articulate various kinds of \u2018trth\u2019 and \u2018turth\u2019 without ever actually claiming that what she writes is entirely authentic. Putting aside the question of authenticity in nonfiction appears to allow for what Attridge calls singularities \u201cthat can be encountered rather than [those] which [are] completely inaccessible to thought or feeling\u201d (2). Such encounters range from the second-person, chilling narration of moments like the one involving Debbie Good (Heart, 182), or the fragrant anthem Krog hears between the suffering at the TRC (Country, 328), or the collaborative, de-signed dialogue of The Number and Three Letter Plague to come. Attridge argues that singularity shares, in particular, a great many features with Derrida\u2019s concept of iterability: a \u2018literary\u2019 work \u2013 or a signature \u2013 is \u201cirreducibly singular [\u2026] yet its singularity only has purchase outside itself, and is only intelligible, because it is repeatable\u201d (3). Just as the experience of this life is simultaneously uniquely yours and common to every being, singularities are unique moments of sincere personal response to a text that nevertheless contain some ineffable, universal thing. For instance, I think it not utterly preposterous to claim that nearly one\u2019s entire critical appreciation of Krog\u2019s text comes down to the singular decision of you the reader to entertain seriously her (deeply problematic) claim that she can write a narrative \u201cfor every black victim with an Afrikaner surname on their lips\u201d (Country, dedication). Kate Highman rejects this claim, and with good reason. She argues that there is a tension in Krog\u2019s writing \u2013 and thought \u2013 between \u201cspecific black voices\u201d and \u201cthe generic black voice,\u201d noting that \u201cauthorship in Country is highly unstable \u2013 words are repeatedly re-ascribed away from their contexts and re-assigned\u201d (\u201cForging\u201d, 188). Through a careful and detailed analysis of Krog\u2019s sources (acknowledged and unacknowledged), Highman argues that there are too many notable elisions between \u2018my real\u2019 and \u2018the real\u2019 in Country, which means that Krog\u2019s \u201cultimate accountability is to her own authorial self [\u2026] rather than to a reader or unspecified addressee or other\u201d (203). Certainly, there are extremely worrying contradictions in both Krog\u2019s writing and thought. Though she argues, in response to her critics, that the \u201cimagination is active in the narrative discourse, not in inventing reality\u201d (\u201cI, me, me mine!\u201d, 106), she invents (predominantly black) figures like Professor Kondlo and conversations with people, like the journalist after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela\u2019s hearing at the TRC (\u201cForging\u201d, 195-9). She adds to, edits and otherwise changes four essential pieces of testimony used to frame her whole narrative in ways which she actively seeks to hide by placing the fragments in quotation marks (189-95). She plagiarises intellectuals like Elaine Scarry, Ariel Dorfman, Pierre Bourdieu, and Julian Pitt-Rivers without acknowledging them, and often elides or over-simplifies key distinctions in their thought, ostensibly in pursuit of the kind of language which shoots up like fire, with both a vision of where \u2018we\u2019 could get to and a firm grip on where \u2018we\u2019 are now (Country, 230-1). Admittedly, Krog lifts large passages without acknowledgement, and adapts them in ways which are not true to their original context (\u201cForging\u201d, 196-8). However, the elision she makes (for instance) between honour=virtue and honour=precedent, which is so important to Pitt-Rivers\u2019 argument (198), does not necessarily amount to misuse precisely because authorship is so unstable in the text. It is not at all clear whose \u2018honour\u2019 is at stake, so whether that honour is properly represented is less important than the way it is intended to be read in the context of performing the \u2018truth\u2019 and anticipating suspicious readings even as detailed and nuanced as Highman\u2019s. For instance, when Krog publishes some of her mother\u2019s essays as part of Country, which read: \u201cI prayed that my hand should fall off if I ever write something for my personal honour at the cost of my people\u201d (Country, 98) it becomes impossible to tell quite whose honour the text is referring to; Krog\u2019s, her mother\u2019s, her family\u2019s, her tribe\u2019s, her race\u2019s, etc. This is complicated further by the fact that the original text was translated from Afrikaans by her son, so might not his \u2018honour\u2019 also be brought into question? Whatever the reader\u2019s decision, it is clear that Krog\u2019s \u201cultimate accountability\u201d cannot only be to her \u201cauthorial self\u201d (\u201cForging\u201d, 203), when that self is so utterly impossible to untangle from the various generations and translations responsible for the text of Country of My Skull in its totality. Furthermore, it is not at all clear whether publishing an originally Afrikaans essay in English constitutes an actual (rather than a merely linguistic) betrayal of her mother\u2019s intention and language or not. There is certainly more than enough evidence to suggest that Krog\u2019s decision to publish in English constitutes a self-conscious betrayal of the blood-lined identity of her family\u2019s language: How do I live with the fact that all the words used to humiliate, all the orders given to kill, belonged to language of my heart? At the hearings, many of the victims faithfully reproduced these parts of their stories in Afrikaans as proof of the bloody fingerprints on them. (238) However, it is possible \u2013 via Krog\u2019s unique and idiosyncratic mechanisms of distortion \u2013 that, in translating her mother\u2019s essay (along with the whole text), she might be betraying her inherited linguistic structures while staying true to the meaning of the words; for is the project of Country not precisely to write something for (all) her people, whom she so desperately wants to believe are both black and white, paying (instead of betraying) with her health, her relationships, and her sense of anything like a stable authorial self, which is to say, with her \u2018sanity\u2019? Rather than merely criticising Krog for betraying body\u2019s like Nomonde Calata\u2019s, modern readers, \u2018in love with artifice\u2019 and seeking \u2018new ways to create the real\u2019, might also be attracted to the \u201clittle red light\u201d on the TRC microphones, \u201cthe ultimate symbol of the whole process: here the marginalised voice speaks to the public ear, the unspeakable is spoken \u2013 and translated \u2013 the personal story brought from the innermost depths of the individual binds us anew to the collective\u201d (359). Krog is actively employing a frame of paradox here \u2013 the unspeakable must always remain unspoken if it is to be \u2018truly\u2019 unspeakable, \u2018ultimate symbols\u2019 of a process as complex and multi-faceted as the TRC are extremely suspicious (even if sincere), and the marginalised voice cannot ever speak to the public ear without distortions which try to map or transform our individual experiences into collective truths. Krog is well aware of the contradictions though, as her essay-response to critics cited above suggests, so the big question really is: why still write in this manner? Perhaps it is because she actively seeks to implicate herself and stage her own complicity, so that her apology can become \u2018truly\u2019 meaningful in the mind of the reader. In order to do so, much like Malan, she adopts a number of different voices: dare I sit in this grape dark during this return journey where my body is overcome by grief my heart coagulate resigned write I \u2013 a blue slit against this all. . . (53) Later, another writing persona \u2013 this time a psychologist \u2013 explains that: \u201cIn my job there are, in a sense, no lies \u2013 all of it ties in, reacts to, plays upon the truth\u201d (117). These two passages seem to anticipate most of Highman\u2019s objections, for every lie \u2018plays upon\u2019 the truth, while the poet sits contemplating darkness and grief, only to write I, which is no more than a shifting blue slit, simultaneously against \u2013 and constitutive \u2013 of \u2018this all\u2019. Country of My Skull ends with another poem: [\u2026] I was scorched A new skin I am changed forever. I want to say: Forgive me Forgive me Forgive me You whom I have wronged, please Take me With you (423) The last three, fractured lines \u2013 in particular \u2013 represent a desire to apologise \u2018truly\u2019 that is primarily dialogic and affective. The \u2018I\u2019 will always betray the \u2018you\u2019 in any attempt to portray that you, yet the two remain fundamentally constitutive of each other. Translated apology, which changes the \u2018I\u2019 forever, becomes Krog\u2019s way of signing in her own tune, of writing \u201csomething which responds or corresponds in an equally singular, which is to say irreducible, irreplaceable, \u2018new\u2019 way\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 5). Attridge explains that singularity, in the \u2018literary\u2019 sense, is \u201ca constellation made possible for both creator and reader by habits of interpreting, thinking, and feeling, inculcated in the course of an existence within a culture or cultures\u201d (7). Within this constellation, different versions of the \u2018trth or turth\u2019 can exist without necessarily contradicting one another, instead bringing readers to a point where the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance is less important than deciding which \u2018truth\u2019 seems most applicable and what this might suggest about the reader\u2019s relationship to \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 in general. Krog, in particular, seems fine with literally inventing some characters and, though the fact that they are black is particularly forced and problematic, Mark Sanders makes the point that It is precisely this element of invention that, along with its active acknowledgement, has the potential to bring a dimension of responsibility to the management of transition. [\u2026] when that past is understood as invented, it can yield a structure of ongoing responsibility rather than a remedy meant to work once and for all. (Complicities, 127) Country of My Skull , regrettably, lacks a large part of the sort of \u2018active acknowledgement\u2019 that Sanders refers to, which means that Highman\u2019s argument remains valid. However, there are certain moments that she misses on account of the hermeneutics of suspicion she employs, moments in which Krog\u2019s signature tune strikes too deep a chord to be dismissed as mere plagiarism. Attridge argues that singularity \u201cmust partake of generality or universality: the signature must use the inscription codes of a particular language\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 4). Quoting an interview of his with Derrida, he explains that \u201cto become readable, [signatures of \u2018literary\u2019 works] have to be divided, to participate and belong. Then it [\u2026] takes its part in the genre, the type, the context, the meaning [\u2026] it loses itself to offer itself (4). In that Country was written in Afrikaans, but published in English first, it is, by its very nature, already-divided between languages. Being already-divided means that the text can participate in (at least) two cultural contexts (Afrikaans and South African English), and at least three genres: \u2018fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u2019 in the attempt to make \u201cthese narratives alone enough to justify the existence of the Truth Commission. Because [\u2026] people can no longer indulge in their separate dynasties of denial\u201d (Country, 134). The ultimate success, such as it may be, of Krog\u2019s work lies in the passages that are not written as a white, or a black (or \u2018the black\u2019), or a poet, or a psychologist, or a man, or a woman, but by a human-being who was \u201cmade to write this story\u201d (54), another performance to be believed, or not; And I wonder: God. Does he hear us? Does He know what our hearts are yearning for? That we all just want to be human \u2013 some with more colour, some with less, but all with air and sun. And I wade into song \u2013 in a language that is not mine, in a tongue I do not know. It is fragrant inside the song, and among the keynotes of sorrow and suffering there are soft silences where we who belong to this landscape, all of us, can come to rest. Sometimes the times we live in overflow with light. (328) As with Simon\u2019s bellow, you can almost hear the fragrant and idiosyncratic tune, even if it is inevitably distorted by Krog\u2019s contradictions and downright dishonesties. It is in a strange language, and it is full of suffering and sorrow, but there is a sense of belonging in it, of the kind of peace attained by Neil Alcock. From between the endless lines of sorrow and death and all \u2018the ways in which we killed one another\u2019, floats the suggestion of a fragrant time overflowing with light, premised on the keynote of human-being, \u2018universal\u2019 suffering, and foldedness this entails. The possibility that the expression of such foldedness might be true, again, seems worth the risk of betraying the human beings and their stories which the sincere author seeks to portray. Jonny Steinberg and Ontological Designing \u201cTo assimilate truth piece by piece\u201d ( Country of My Skull , 193) Steinberg, Malan, and Krog have all appeared on panel discussions together, the most recent entitled \u201cIn a Place Where You Couldn\u2019t Make This Shit Up\u201d, at the 2010 Cape Town Book Fair. While each wrote/writes at a unique and specific time, their work shares many similarities, chief among them the fact that, though the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within their texts complicates each telling. Malan pleaded with \u2018visionary readers\u2019 in the late 1980\u2019s to see the ways in which South Africans were killing each other and to seek, instead, a different kind of love: \u2018You said one could be deformed by this country, and yet it seems to me one can only be deformed by the things one does to oneself [\u2026] The only thing you can do is love, because it\u2019s the only thing which leaves light inside you, instead of total, obliterating darkness.\u2019 (Heart, 409) The \u2018you\u2019 here actually refers to Malan, who is listening to Creina Alcock speak. The shifting pronouns allow \u201cthe truly valuable in human life\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 135) to exist for a moment without irony, rendered sincerely through the voice of an other, an I-who-is-not-the-writer, while the writer and the reader become essentially indistinguishable as the you who is addressed. Krog (and her son) translate her own and other\u2019s work (as well as, problematically, adapting testimony to suit her own ends) which is to say she stages her own complicity in acts of plagiarism and (mis)appropriation, but insists on being read in a bilingual, impure, performative context of \u201cfact bordering on fiction but marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 106). In addition to the psychologist, or the apologetic poet, Krog also inserts the voices of others into the narrative, from her mother\u2019s essays to the student from Ladybrand, whose poem Krog leaves in Afrikaans, and then translates into English on the opposite page (Country, 316-7). The final, circular couplet sums up how I read the intention of Krog\u2019s multilingual, multigenerational text, in that it captures the attempt to hear the various voices at work in the text, to see the value in the mere fact that the narrative even exists: \u201cas jy gesien het/ het jy vir altyd gesien\u201d (316). As already noted, Steinberg acknowledges in his first book that \u201cI am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and I am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. I announce up front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 218). He self-consciously places his authorial self by virtue of his skin colour and the line of (white) writers of which he is a part, while simultaneously setting his (ethnographic) methodology apart from those who have come before him. It is important that one of the defining characteristics he identifies in his predecessors is \u2018failure\u2019. In a sense, white South African writing can only be dialogic and affective, it can only anticipate an other\u2019s response, precisely by failing; by performing believably the human failure of its own \u2018traitorous heart\u2019. If it does so, such nonfiction might have the potential, like nothing as experienced a reader and writer as Salman Rushdie has \u201cread before\u201d, to express \u201cthe demotic voice of black and Afrikaner South Africa\u201d (Heart, Introductory Note, emphasis added). Steinberg seems to feel, from his first book, that he owes \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (xi) to his subjects. However, instead of irony, translation, and (mis)appropriation, he attempts to create a more open and honest sense of collaboration aimed at collapsing the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance entirely. As Twidle notes of his \u201cflat [\u2026] character-driven prose\u201d (\u201cIn a Place\u201d, 10), Steinberg quite literally collaborates with people like Magadien Wentzel or Sizwe Magadla to produce works like The Number (2004) and Three Letter Plague (2009), but I think the way he designs his research and the resultant texts goes far deeper than these collaborations. In all his work, Steinberg actively acknowledges both the readers, critics, and intellectuals who helped him, from Mark Gevisser and Anthony Altbeker, to Ivan Vladislavi\u010d \u2013 \u201cfrom whose experience and perspicacity [Steinberg] benefited three times in a row\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 390) \u2013 as well as the institutions which funded and supported his research. From the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, to the Development Corporation Ireland (The Number, vii), all are faithfully and openly acknowledged as having played a role in the overall design of each work. These acknowledgements may seem like staples of a certain kind of ethnographic, academic research and texts. However, Anne-Marie Willis explains that \u2018ontological designing\u2019 \u2013 i.e. self-consciously creating different \u2018ways of knowing\u2019 \u2013 is \u201ca theory: that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; that designing is fundamental to being human \u2014 we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings \u2014 in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e.,through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); that this adds up to a double movement \u2014 we design our world, while our world acts back [\u2026] and designs us.\u201d (80) Acknowledging one\u2019s sources is certainly not unique to Steinberg, but the point here is that openly designing and honestly discussing the ways in which one comes to \u2018know\u2019 something adds a further element of responsibility to nonfiction texts by showing them to be divided (between different character\u2019s interpretations, different reader\u2019s opinions, and different institution\u2019s requirements) and therefore allowing them to \u2018participate in and belong to\u2019 various different contexts and \u2018realities\u2019 (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 4). Ontological designing is also an extension of Kelly\u2019s logic: we anticipate other\u2019s reactions in such a way that \u201cinner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136) and, in the same way (although applied not just to others, but practices and objects as well) \u201cwe design our world, while our world acts back [\u2026] and designs us\u201d (\u201cDesigning\u201d, 80). Steinberg\u2019s carefully researched, ethnographic, character-driven prose shows how anticipatory logic can be used not only to negotiate irony (like Malan) or complicity (like Krog), but actively to design textual spaces in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside momentarily so as to consider the possibilities believing any given performance might allow. \u201cIt occurred to me that of all the motives that propelled Magadien to cooperate so enthusiastically with the writing of this book, this was the most important: he wanted to rescue his history from the tongues of others\u201d (The Number, 371). Here is another example of a frame of paradox: the implication that Magadien might be able to rescue his history from the tongues of others is only accessible through, or legible because of, the pen of exactly such a white, English-speaking, upper-middle-class other. But this is also exactly the point; Steinberg\u2019s is just a pen, The Number just a book, which is to say that it is concerned with \u201cartifice [\u2026] and new means of creating the \u2018real\u2019\u201d (Reality, 4). In understanding the \u2018real\u2019 \u2013 in this case, a space where Magadien has rescued his story from the tongues of others \u2013 as fundamentally created, readers can self-consciously choose whether to believe the persona \u2018Jonny Steinberg\u2019 and his collaborators (Sizwe and Magadien at the level of characters, Vladislavi\u0107 and Altbeker at the level of readers, the CSVR etc. at the level of institutions), or not. I suggest that Jonny Steinberg\u2019s work takes the logic of anticipation and applies it with a \u201cradically different understanding of how modern subjects are and come to be who/what we are in the modern world\u201d (\u201cOntological Designing, 2006: 80). We can re-read an earlier quotation, sentence for sentence, in the context of ontological designing: I shut up. The subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the \u2018I\u2019 up. But he had, of course, told the \u2018I\u2019 precisely what every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear. He had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. The victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (The Number, 242) The first sentence represents an assertion of unbridled agency on the writing persona\u2019s part \u2013 he actively shuts up and creates a silent world. However, this is complicated by the next two sentences, written from a perspective outside the I-who-writes, which suggest that it is not the \u2018I\u2019 who shut up, but rather the subject the \u2018I\u2019 was in dialogue with who shut that \u2018I\u2019 up. Furthermore, it was, in fact, the subject who anticipated \u201cwhat every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear\u201d, rather than the other way around. The perspective then shifts back to within the I-who-writes, but no longer does he engage in bald and uncomplicated assertions of agency. Rather, he expresses the nuanced sort of acknowledgement which could potentially collapse the distinction between truth and its performance: the \u2018victory\u2019 (that is, the licence to portray the \u2018heart\u2019 and \u2018soul\u2019 of an other) remains, inevitably, the (believably) anxious writing persona\u2019s. To reiterate, in the context of textual spaces in which \u201cwe are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed\u201d (\u201cDesigning, 80), the logic of anticipation works two ways. Though the \u2018I\u2019 is unable to transcend the kind of betrayal that representational \u2018victory\u2019 always implies, Steinberg seems to have created a space where the subject\u2019s words anticipate what he, as the writing persona \u2018I\u2019, needs to hear. And it is not just him, but every \u2018I\u2019, every writing (and reading) persona within the text. This is achieved both through the way Steinberg openly interacts with the characters (who are also real people, although their real names are not given), readers (both \u2018the reader\u2019 of his text, and \u2018real\u2019 people like Gevisser, Altbeker etc.) and institutions which make up his textual environment. By showing actively how he has designed this textual environment, Steinberg simultaneously reveals how the environment, also, designs his texts. We are no longer speaking only of writing and reading sincerely so as to elide the distinction between truth and its performance, in search of different possibilities for meaning and the expression of the \u2018truly valuable in human life\u2019. Ontological designing is about creating singular works which actively collapse truth and its performance in order to get at \u2018something more than truthfulness\u2019. In The Number , this something seems primarily to have to do with how one chooses to name things. \u201cHe has always understood the power of this mask [\u2026] it is William, but it cannot possibly be William\u201d (299) Steinberg explains, showing how the character \u2018Magadien\u2019, too, shifts between various identities that he self-consciously creates for himself. Earlier in the text, Steinberg questions Magadien about how much really hinges on a name, to which the subject takes offense: \u201cMy life goes round in these circles. You ask why a name is so important. I am telling you why. I need to be Magadien Wentzel to live a proper life\u2019\u201d (31). Here, again, we have both writer and reader addressed as \u2018you\u2019 in dialogue with a character in the text. The writer\u2019s (and reader\u2019s) question is answered \u2013 is anticipated by \u2013 Magadien, who is always in the process of telling, in the process of revealing aspects of his identity the writing persona cannot, actually, claim full \u2018victory\u2019 over. Here, the subject speaks as \u2018I\u2019 and is, again, able to anticipate the writing persona\u2019s questions, to exercise his own agency in terms of how he is read and understood. Ultimately, Magadien\u2019s obsession with naming is revealed to stem from his need to have \u201cthe truth written on my grave\u201d (92). Again then, the reader is confronted by the impossibility of true responsibility before anything but the \u201cmore or less transcendental figure of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 98) which is embodied by death, or more specifically here, \u2018my grave\u2019. The appeal to death as originary of a different kind of responsibility (and collaboration) is a pattern which gets repeated in greater detail in Steinberg\u2019s following work, Three Letter Plague , which is, again, radically open about its own \u201cuniquely intimate, uniquely intrusive\u201d structure (2009: 183). Although very different from Magadien, the persona labeled \u2018Sizwe\u2019 is also no more than his own, unique \u201cassemblage of paradoxes\u201d (47), acting as an \u201cinterpreter-subject\u201d in a text often written using the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d (247). Sizwe\u2019s becomes a story of identifying with the dying and dead in strange \u2013 but often surprisingly innovative and courageous \u2013 ways given his context; while he remains living on his own, uniquely flawed, terms. Sizwe looked into Jake\u2019s dying face and saw himself. For a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved. Who lay on the bed and who stood up healthy and strong was merely a question of chance. It was an unusual moment, one that embodied an attitude to AIDS that Sizwe would struggle to re-create in time to come. For it is not an easy thing identifying with the dying and the dead. Among our deepest responses to them is an unacknowledged feeling of triumph. (30-1) Truthfully, how could the writing persona ever know what Sizwe saw when he looked into Jake\u2019s dying face, and is it not deeply offensive to assume he could? My proposition is that reading sincerely and actively designing a singular response to (collaborative) performances aimed at \u2018dissolving boundaries\u2019 \u2013 or writing the truth on \u2018my grave\u2019 \u2013 does not make universalising or generalising assumptions like the above any less problematic or narcissistic. However, by the end of the passage, through a seemingly heartfelt acknowledgement that it is no easy thing to identify with the dying and dead, the writing persona shifts to the pronoun \u2018our\u2019. And so what if this \u2018our\u2019 is the fictional result of problematic generalisation? If white South African nonfiction writers insist upon writing \u2018fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u2019, then does it not seem almost noble (and a little tragic), that the pronoun \u2018our\u2019 is the element of fiction they would use \u201cto enable our facts to arrive at the truth\u201d ( I\u2019, me, me, mine!\u201d, 101)? The element for which writers are willing to take almost any kind of artistic risk, from adopting and adapting the voices of others, translating their own (and other\u2019s work), plagiarising, misappropriating, shifting between pronouns, dissolving boundaries and designing dialogue which de-signs their own ability to represent their subjects? Claiming the ability to anticipate others\u2019 reactions necessarily implies an element of narcissism and egoism, to which all that can be said is that sincerity, too, depends on the possibility of manipulation and \u2013 indeed \u2013 it is precisely this possibility which renders the idea meaningful at all. Attridge\u2019s concept of the \u2018singularity\u2019 of literary works has always depended on the reader, or \u201chuman translator\u201d, and their singular \u201cdecision\u201d which attempts to stay faithful to \u201cthe singularizing event\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 17-8). The whole point of advertising work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019, or of adopting a logic of anticipation, or of designing ontologies within any given text, is to allow for and encourage the \u201chuman translator\u201d to create or de-sign their own response to the singular events surrounding each text. Rather than question authenticity, each reader, therefore, ought to ask of each performance which interpretation, which unacceptable decision, seems most \u2018true\u2019 to them and what this might imply about their own relationship to \u2018reality\u2019 and the \u2018truth\u2019, both as an individual and as part of a collective \u2013 that is \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018South African\u2019. Conclusion \u201cPerhaps, in the end, that was Hermann\u2019s gift to Lusikisiki [\u2026] people who had come to see, through the potency of their own deeds, that the horizon of the possible stretched further than they had ever imagined\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 328). This, I would argue, is primarily what Steinberg\u2019s ethnographic methodology is aimed at expressing: just how potent anyone\u2019s own deeds can be in terms of creating or designing the ways in which we read and translate (performances of) the \u2018truth\u2019, whether it is as writer, reader, \u2018real\u2019 person, or character. More generally, though the marketing of nonfiction sets up a superficial relationship of I=writer, and you=reader, the ways pronouns shift within all the supposedly \u2018true\u2019 texts I have chosen above is used by all three writers to create dialogic and affective texts in which the distinction between truth and its performance is not as important, perhaps, as deciding \u2013 in the way of a singular \u2018human translator attempting to stay true to the \u2018singularizing event\u2019 \u2013 what kinds of meaning are to be found by believing the marketing claims and reading sincerely (which is also to perform in a certain way). The representational \u2018victory\u2019, the betrayal, the universalising impulse to describe individual bodies or screams as symbolic of a national narrative of pain and healing all remain the writer\u2019s (and reader\u2019s, who is often collapsed with the writer as \u2018you\u2019 in the address of a character). However, by asserting \u2018our\u2019 own complicity, or by actively designing and de-signing textual spaces, both writers and readers can negotiate the distinction between truth and its performance and seek, instead, \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (Midlands, 218). This something, I suggest, has the same indescribable, ineffable structure as Attridge\u2019s \u2018singularity\u2019, though it can be said to originate not only in death, but also in love: \u201cHis love is of course selfish: it is his progeny, and no one else, for whom he wakes up in the mornings. But what fiery and desperate love it is\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 343): the sort of defeated love that could lead a few human-beings back home; the appropriated love of a forged and fragrant song, a selfish love for those yet to come and those already-gone; a crying love, universal at times, but lost when we wake from our dreams and can no longer see \u201cthe grand design, such as it is\u201d (Heart, 13). Geometric Proof \u2018[\u2026] love is worth nothing until tested by its own defeat [\u2026] I realized that love, even if it ends in defeat, gives you a kind of honour; but without love, you have no honour at all. I think that is what I misunderstood all my life. Love is to enable you to transcend defeat. \u2018You said one could be deformed by this country, and yet it seems to me one can only be deformed by the things one does to oneself [\u2026] The only thing you can do is love, because its the only thing which leaves light inside you, instead of total, obliterating darkness. (Traitor\u2019s, 409) What follows below is, while seemingly silly, actually a geometric summation of the thesis above, otherwise entitled \u2018An Argument for Happiness\u2019. The stages on which \u2018our\u2019 consciousness now unfolds are definitely more complex. Sooner than you think, some humans will be computing with matter itself, while others turn the Earth into a radio-telescope to keep up the eternal search for our origins, while for millions more not a single thing will be different. If one were to think of evolution as a series of haphazardly-linked circles, then it sometimes seems as if we fall further and further into complexity. However, one might just as well see it as a rise, a move against entropy. \u201cAs a result of a thousand million years of evolution, the universe is becoming conscious of itself, able to understand something of its past history and its possible future\u201d (Julian Huxley, \u201cTranshumanism\u201d in New Bottles for New Wine (1957): 13) See also Alain de Botton: \u201cAlthough this house may lack solutions to a great many of its occupants\u2019 ills, its rooms nevertheless give evidence of a happiness to which [design] has made a distinctive contribution\u201d (The Architecture of Happiness.

However, if \u2013 as Kelly claims \u2013 one can never tell the sincere from the manipulative, then are ways of writing which are advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019 to be read sincerely or suspiciously? If there is no way of separating \u2018truth\u2019 from the performance of truth, then what warrants the description \u2018exemplary and courageous\u2019 and why do critics like Hedley Twidle emphasise the \u201ccurrent success of nonfiction in South Africa\u201d (\u201cIn a Place\u201d, 2012: 6)? Nonfiction makes its primary truth-claims via marketing which places it in a specific, verifiable \u2018reality\u2019. As Salman Rushdie says in his short introductory note: \u201cThe book Rian Malan set out to write is altogether more conventional than the one he has written [\u2026] along the way, he ran into, and faced up to, the truth that is the making of his book [\u2026] that he could only write about the atrocity of South Africa by admitting the atrocity hidden in his own traitorous heart.\u201d In other words, though nonfiction is advertised as being about \u2018reality\u2019, one can only express the \u2018truth\u2019 by performing one\u2019s own role in creating that \u2018truth\u2019. The \u2018reality\u2019 of nonfiction is revealed by showing how the \u2018truth\u2019 depends on the reader\u2019s belief in such admissions of treachery and their awareness of the way \u2018reality\u2019 is inevitably manipulated in order to represent unconventional and traitorous \u2013 yet affective and self-conscious \u2013 \u2018truths\u2019. David Shields argues that the desire to break \u201clarger and larger chunks of \u2018reality\u2019\u201d into artistic works is, in fact, common to \u201ca burgeoning group of interrelated but unconnected artists in a multitude of forms and media\u201d (Reality Hunger, 2010: 3). Shields claims this \u2018reality hunger\u2019 to be present in almost any artistic movement, arguing that modern readers are both \u201cdesperate for authenticity and in love with artifice, they know all the moments are \u2018moments\u2019: staged and theatrical, shaped and thematized\u201d (5). Importantly, Shields\u2019 \u201cantigenre [\u2026] relies on viewer awareness of the creator\u2019s self-conscious, wobbly manipulation of the gap between person and persona\u201d (4). My focus in this essay will therefore be on the ways in which the gaps between person and persona and \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance are manipulated, as well as how \u2013 even as performances \u2013 such manipulative moments might be read sincerely so as to grasp at \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (Midlands, 2002: x), something describable only in terms of Derek Attridge\u2019s concept of \u201cSingularity\u201d (2014). Rian Malan\u2019s My Traitor\u2019s Heart , Antjie Krog\u2019s Country of My Skull (1998), and Jonny Steinberg\u2019s The Number (2004) all rely on similar kinds of self-conscious address and manipulation, beginning with Malan\u2019s very first words: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m burned out and starving to death, so I\u2019m just going to lay this all on you and trust that you\u2019re a visionary reader\u201d (Heart, 13). Each work exhibits what Shields calls \u201cplasticity of form\u201d (Reality, 5), moving between narrative voices and different modes of address to reveal a deep concern with the acts of interpretation, translation, speaking, and listening between black and white, English and Afrikaans, Afrikaans and Zulu, and so on. Self-conscious, if wobbly, manipulation of the gap between person and persona relies on what Adam Kelly calls a \u201clogic of anticipation\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136). He explains that \u201cthe anticipation of others\u2019 reception of one\u2019s outward behaviour [\u2026] begins to take priority for the acting self, so that inner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic\u201d (136). In other words, how we expect others to react becomes the originating cause of how we present ourselves, which can be read either as deeply narcissistic, or as a sincere attempt to engender a different kind of responsibility. It all depends on what the reader chooses to make of the performance. Kelly describes anticipation as that which morphs \u201cdivisions between self and other [\u2026] into conflicts with the self, and a recursive and paranoid cycle of endless anticipation begins, putting in doubt the very referents [\u2026] \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019, \u2018inner\u2019 and outer\u2019\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136). Steinberg\u2019s work, grounded as it is in his methods of ethnographic research, seems most concerned with conflicts between the self and how these relate to an external world shared with others. He returns time and again to the problems of narrating anyone\u2019s story but one\u2019s own: I shut up. The subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the \u2018I\u2019 up. But he had, of course, told the \u2018I\u2019 precisely what every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear. He had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. The victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (The Number, 242) Each sentence adapts the claims of the last, and the shifts from I to \u2018I\u2019, to he and \u2018I\u2019, to he and me, clearly stage the ways in which it is possible to manipulate the gap between person and persona, which Shields claims to be a definitive feature of reality hungry art. Steinberg seems well aware that for a white man to declare he can write a story concerned with the lived experiences of \u2018South Africans\u2019 in general is highly suspicious: \u201cI am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and I am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. I announce up front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 2002: 218). Given that the last sentence takes the form of an announcement, this too can be read as fundamentally performative, but it is a performance which Steinberg insists is based upon research and various \u2018gathered materials\u2019. If we lay aside for a moment the \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 140) which Kelly argues gloss over the \u201ctruly valuable in human life [\u2026] love, trust, faith and responsibility\u201d (135), is it not possible to make performances like this \u2018true\u2019 in so far as the reader believes in them, knowing the writer to be as \u2018anxious\u2019 about such an extension of trust as they are? Furthermore, the fact that Steinberg is designing texts in which the \u2018colour of his skin\u2019, the \u2018failure of his predecessors\u2019 and the fact that he deliberately withholds information, paradoxically, seems to add to the truth-value of the work, means the question becomes not just one of reading sincerely and believing the performance, but how we might actively design the ways we read and write to include \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, rather than hoping for Malan\u2019s \u2018visionary reader\u2019 and reading suspiciously. \u2018Love, trust, faith and responsibility\u2019 seems to be most affectively expressed in the self-conscious manipulation of the gap between person and persona, yet there remains something deeply artificial, something staged, about the ways in which all three writers are able to interact with and interpret the \u201cirreconcilable realities\u201d, or \u201cseparate psychic trenches\u201d (Heart, 412) of South Africa and her people. However, as Shields argues, \u2018reality hungry\u2019 art negotiates paradoxes like this with elements including: \u201cartistic risk, emotional intensity and urgency, reader/viewer participation; [and] an overly literal tone, as if a reporter were viewing a strange culture\u201d (5). When Steinberg announces \u201cup front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 218), this is both to take a big artistic risk, and to engage actively in a dialogue with you, the reader, in something approaching an \u2018overly literal tone\u2019. Moreover, \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019 are not stable within any of the texts I have chosen, so while the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. All three writers are addressed as \u2018you\u2019 at various different stages by both fictional characters (like Professor Kondlo) and \u2018real\u2019 people like Magadien: \u201cI am telling you. I need to be Magadien Wentzel to live a proper life\u201d (The Number, 31) or Creina Alcock: \u201cthe only thing you can do is love\u201d (Heart, 409), which is to collapse both writer and reader into the second person. As Phillip Lopate notes, \u201cthe solution to entrapment in the narcissistic hothouse of self is not to relinquish autobiographical writing, but to expand the self by bringing one\u2019s curiosity to interface with more and more history and the present world\u201d (To Show and Tell, 2013: 10-11). Broadly speaking, autobiography has to do with narratives concerned primarily with the self, told by the self; whereas nonfiction \u2013 in my terms \u2013 has to do with narratives primarily about a wider, shared \u2018reality\u2019 told by a self as an act of collaboration with that \u2018reality\u2019 and the people, objects, and practices of which it is constituted. Steinberg\u2019s work is, again, exemplary in terms of the kinds of collaboration it allows for \u2013 not only between writer, characters (who are also interpreters, translators and contributors) and readers \u2013 but also between the persona \u2018Jonny Steinberg\u2019 and various well-known South African intellectuals and institutions, from Ivan Vladislavi\u0107 to the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, who funded his research for The Number (2004: ix). In a very \u2018real\u2019 and open way, Steinberg designs textual spaces which de-sign him back, so that it is not only about reading sincerely, but creating works (as both writers and readers) in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside in order to express \u2018something more than truthfulness\u2019, something with the same ineffable structure of Attridge\u2019s \u2018singularity\u2019. Anne-Marie Willis concept of \u201contological designing\u201d acknowledges that, while we design our spaces (and here she means literally any self-consciously designed space, be it structural, material, textual or otherwise), \u201cin turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed\u201d (\u201cOntological Designing\u201d, 2006: 80). Therefore, the fact that Malan, Krog, and Steinberg all worked as reporters plays an integral role in the nature and quality of each of their texts. Rian Malan, descended from the first Dutch settlers themselves, worked for a time on \u201cthe crime beat\u201d (Heart, 35), which obliterated his \u201ccertainties\u201d (330) and drove him into exile rather than carry arms for the apartheid government. His fractured experience resulted in an ironic book written and published in English by Vintage, \u201cwhich tells us of the defeat of its authors illusions, his ideals, his sense of courage, his ability to comprehend his fellow South Africans as they danced their death dances\u201d (Salman Rushdie, Introductory Note). Antjie Krog, also Afrikaans, worked as a reporter at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, leading to the skin-scorching Country of My Skull, which she actually wrote in Afrikaans first, although published it in English for reasons I will deal with later. Jonny Steinberg, all of whose books are written and published in English, also worked as a reporter and columnist (some of which is collected into Notes From a Fractured Country (2007)) for a number of publications. Just like Malan before him, he often ventures into some of the most dangerous and dilapidated parts of the country. Rather than irony though, the way he collaborates with both characters and \u2018real\u2019 people \u2013 who are often impossible to distinguish on account of him being open about the fact that he regularly changes names to protect or respect people \u2013 means that uncertainty and a certain kind of fracturing becomes a structural feature of his work. Writing in Afrikaans and publishing in English, or inserting passages which assess the role of the writing \u2018I\u2019, or passages in which writer and reader are collapsed in the second-person address of a character, suggests that the works I have chosen have primarily to do with different kinds of fracture and breaks with representation to get at an ultimately performative array of \u201cturth or trth\u201d (Country, 54). This \u2018truth\u2019, which Krog shows she cannot even type, is unique to each individual, time and experience (apartheid, TRC, postapartheid) and yet also shared in some fundamental, \u201cfolded\u201d, and common experience of what Mark Sanders calls \u201chuman-being\u201d (Complicities, 2002: 89). However, unlike hard news reports, South African nonfiction seems exemplary in that it is not \u2018desperate\u2019 for what Shields calls \u201cauthenticity\u201d (Reality, 5). As Antjie Krog writes: if you believe your own lie \u2013 because as narrators we all give ourselves permission to believe our own versions \u2013 how can it be said that you are being misleading? To what extent can you bring yourself not to know what you know? Eventually it is not the lie that matters, but the mechanism in yourself that allows you to accept distortions. (Country, 133) The use of shifting pronouns is clear here: the second-person address implicates the reader, then the parentheses works to include that reader in a wider circle of narrators, all of whom lie and mislead and accept that their \u2018truths\u2019 will always be in some way distorted. Nonfiction, in Krog\u2019s view, is doomed always to manipulate its \u2018trth\u2019 and so is concerned not with authenticity, but with sincerity; with the ability to believe your own lies and thereby perform the \u2018truth\u2019 \u2013 both while writing, as well as while interpreting/reading/translating that \u2018truth\u2019. Lionel Trilling defined sincerity as \u201ca congruence of avowal and actual feeling\u201d (Sincerity and Authenticity, 2), going on to point out that it has been \u201ca salient, perhaps a definitive, characteristic of Western culture for some four hundred years\u201d(6). Most importantly, sincerity retains a notion of the \u201cperformative, [of its] theatrical origins\u201d (9). David Shields argues that, inundated by such performances, modern readers have become more skeptical than ever \u201cof the desperation of the modernist embrace of art as the only solution, and hyperaware of all artifices of genre and form, [yet] we nevertheless seek new means of creating the real\u201d (24). In order to \u2018create the real\u2019 in a believable fashion, Adam Kelly argues that we need to do away with \u201cthe ideal of authenticity, which conceives truth to the self as an end\u201d, and return to Trilling\u2019s (and Shakespeare\u2019s) formulation of sincerity as an ideal involving \u201ctruth to the self [\u2026 only] as a means of ensuring truth to the other\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 132). He goes on: sincerity places emphasis on intersubjective truth and communication with others, and [with] what Trilling calls the \u2018public end in view\u2019, authenticity conceives truth as something inward, personal, and hidden, the goal primarily of self-expression rather than other-directed communication. (132) In other words, the kinds of \u2018truth\u2019 sincere nonfiction can express are primarily dialogic and affective. Essentially, Kelly is suggesting that we do not need new means of creating the real, merely old ones that have been reinterpreted within a world inundated by other-directed communication. The question becomes one of creating the \u2018real\u2019 in believable ways, which is something Malan, Krog, and Steinberg achieve via different techniques, though I will argue that the collaborative and anticipatory frames within which Steinberg conducts his research and writing are exemplary of a new kind of \u201cOntological Designing\u201d (Anne-Marie Willis, 2006) beginning to take form in the apparent formlessness of Shields\u2019 \u201cantigenre\u201d (Reality, 4). Put differently, sincere writing which anticipates its own ability to manipulate, or marketing that discusses its own narcissism, or \u2018reality\u2019 that shows up its own artifice, are all made meaningful only via a collaborative, dialogic, and informative performance of the \u2018truth\u2019 they are advertised to represent. Antjie Krog insists that she writes \u201cfiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 2005: 106) which is to make a distinction that, as Kelly notes of advertising in general, \u201chighlights the complexity and impurity of all discourse,\u201d that can \u201conly be responded to by acknowledging one\u2019s own implication in [Derrida\u2019s] \u2018general system of writing\u2019\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 139). In that the logic of anticipation \u2013 or the self-conscious manipulation between person and persona \u2013 relies on a response to the other before they have even reacted, performing sincerely and believably requires an assertion of responsibility for one\u2019s audience(s). However, just as \u201ctrue sincerity, if there ever is such a thing, must take place in the aporia between the conditional and the unconditional\u201d (140), true responsibility \u2013 as Mark Sanders notes \u2013 would only be possible before a \u201cmore or less transcendental figure of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 2002: 98), which is none other than the aporia of death: \u201cSizwe looked into Jake\u2019s dying face and saw himself. For a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 30). Negotiating the inability to be responsible before anything but death, which is the only thing that \u2018truly\u2019 dissolves boundaries like the one between Sizwe and Jake (or Sizwe and Steinberg), requires asserting complicity in Sanders\u2019 framework: a certain kind of \u201cfoldedness in human-being\u201d (98). Human-being, the category from which Simon Mpungose is excluded in My Traitor\u2019s Heart (212), does not refer only to the human beings we interact with daily, but the \u201ctotal existential situation of being human in the world\u201d (Complicities, 89); of responding in a singular and idiosyncratic way to the shared experience of \u2018reality\u2019. Importantly though, human-being is not a transcendental point from which to judge truth from ideology; it is rather a \u201cself-conscious placing of the self\u201d (91) within a wider space of reciprocal, translating/translated address. Fact and fiction may be impossible to separate in work like Malan\u2019s, Krog\u2019s, and Steinberg\u2019s, but if we lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion for a moment and interpret and translate their words and works sincerely, new possibilities are created for the expression of the \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, thereby turning narratives primarily about the self (autobiography) into wider narratives about a more generally applicable and historically recognisable \u2018truth\u2019 (nonfiction).","title":"Setting the Stage"},{"location":"academy/yours-sincerely/#rian-malan-and-linguistic-address","text":"\u201cWe tell stories not to die of life\u201d (Country of My Skull, 72) My Traitor\u2019s Heart begins with a direct plea from the \u201cburned out and starving\u201d writer to the \u201cvisionary reader\u201d (13). However, Malan often steps away from his narrative and \u2018listens\u2019 to the testimonies and narratives of people like Simon Mpungose (181-205) and Creina Alcock (342-425), becoming the you that they address (409). Adam Kelly argues that any decision regarding the writer\u2019s intention within an anticipatory framework can \u201conly be made by a particular kind of listener\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 141) and I think that Malan\u2019s use of multiple narrative voices is intended to force both himself and the reader to listen closely to what is being said and who is saying it. By the end of the narrative, the writer admits that \u201cI\u2019m so deeply enmeshed in half-truths and fictionalizations of myself that I will never escape until I simply tell the truth. This was not the book I was contracted to write\u201d (410). Fact and fiction are presented as essentially continuous here, and the possibility of \u2018simply telling the truth\u2019 after four hundred and ten pages seems as likely to happen as the expression of true sincerity or responsibility. The wobbly manipulation of person and persona, of the I-who-writes and the I-who-was-contracted-to-write, can be read either as a kind of egoism and self-aggrandisement, or (if such egoism is read as already-anticipated) as a sincere plea to have the reader believe that his desire to \u2018simply tell the truth\u2019 is the real truth \u2013 not facts, not fiction, but the desire to speak your \u2018truth\u2019 and be heard. In other words, the believable performance of the \u2018truth\u2019 requires both readers and writers to lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion and find a way back to \u2018the truly valuable in human life\u2019, together. Emile Benveniste explains that \u201cI use I only when I am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address. It is this condition of dialogue that is constitutive of person, for it implies that reciprocally I becomes you in the address of the one who in turn designates himself as I\u201d (Problems in General Linguistics, 1971: 224-5). Again, the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, though the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. I and you shift, as Benveniste later says, between \u201ca set of empty signs [\u2026] which are filled as the speaker adopts them\u201d (286): \u2018[\u2026] I have noticed there is no fairness on this earth. So, I must die, so that what I dreamed in 1972 be fulfilled. \u2018That is all I wish to say\u2019 Ah, Simon, Simon, in spite of all I know about you, your words still break my heart. Simon was a killer, and yet, as a friend of mine pointed out, his story seemed to unfold like the story of a saint, deeply disturbing in its biblical parallels [\u2026] I heard no hatred or despair in his last words, just clarity, which he seemed to be offering as a man offers a gift \u2013 a gift of understanding, I thought, and a warning [\u2026] As it turned out, I presumed a great deal. (Heart, 204-5) Here, the I starts off as Simon, as he was heard speaking in court, then it shifts to the writer, who addresses Simon directly (in the present tense), and then the I shifts again to a more personal meditation (presumably Malan\u2019s own, in the past tense). Simon is presented in this passage as both a psychopathic killer and a saint, sent to save his people with a hammer and a dream. Neither interpretation is quite right, but nor is either one entirely wrong. Both are unsettled by the shifts in person and tense. Simon\u2019s story, which takes up a large part of the total narrative, begins with near fairy-tale like narration: \u201cNow comes another tale of ordinary life and extraordinary death in my country. Take my hand, and let\u2019s fly like gods to where it happened\u201d (181) and he is introduced first through the eyes of Debbie Good, one of his victims. The I-who-writes ventriloquises her experience of waking up with Simon in her room, using second person narration to chilling effect: You never know when, but you know it\u2019s coming. And then one night you go to bed around ten. You hear the old red setter barking outside [\u2026] All you remember is the split second of terror when you wake up [\u2026] drenched in blood [\u2026] You\u2019re trying to phone the doctor but you can\u2019t remember how to dial. (186) Carrol Clarkson discusses how you, as addressee of a literary work, gains another dimension when a persona within the world of the novel is addressed as \u2018you\u2019: the use of persona address has the unnerving effect of placing the reader simultaneously in the grammatical position of the second and third persons, at once present and absent with respect to a double-directedness and mutually exclusive trajectory of address. (Coetzee\u2019s Countervoices, 2009: 61) Reader and writer slip between the shifting pronouns, but this is exactly what Malan intends, for to have a fixed concept of the reader is, as Clarkson argues, \u201cto ignore the capacity for the invention and freedom of the artwork\u2019s transcendence in the pure potentiality of \u2018You\u2019\u201d (61). The \u2018pure potentiality of you\u2019 is what makes sincerity a two-way phenomenon \u2013 each reader or listener is forced into making a singular and idiosyncratic decision about the intention of dialogic and/or affective modes of address given that the book is advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019. In the context of such \u2018truth\u2019, what is particularly interesting in My Traitor\u2019s Heart is that it is not just Debbie Good\u2019s eyes, but her race, which is ventriloquised: \u201cto understand such things, you must see them in the context of the state of elemental guilt and fear in which white South Africans live\u201d (189). You, the reader of an English book, published internationally \u2013 but written by an Afrikaner with \u201ca sickness of the soul\u201d (412) \u2013 can only understand such things if you attempt to see from the perspective of Debbie Good (all the while noting how this perspective alters and manipulates Simon\u2019s story). When reader, writer and characters start to slip between these shifting you\u2019s, she\u2019s, and I\u2019s in nonfiction specifically, then it is perhaps not quite \u2018pure potentiality\u2019 we should speak of, but a limited potential to experience the \u2018truth\u2019 as it applies to more than just one\u2019s self: though Malan\u2019s work is \u201cfull of bitterness, cynicism, anger and storms, [it is also] a triumphant instance of [\u2026] defeated love\u201d (Salman Rushdie, Introductory Note). Simon\u2019s courtroom testimony, which appears in quotation marks (181-205) is occasionally interrupted by the I-who-writes to provide more information about the people in the gallery, or the finer points of Zulu metaphor. This may seem problematic \u2013 what gives Malan the right to interpret when the court obviously could not? \u2013 but the writer is also quick to note the fact that \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s words defeated the interpreter\u201d (202). Once again, we are given the opportunity to read the interpretations as manipulative or as springing from the writer\u2019s self-aware sense of defeated love. Simon\u2019s smile vanishes, he sobs, \u201cand then he was suddenly bellowing and howling, like a man in unendurable pain. It was a harrowing sound, the sound of a bull with a sword in its heart\u201d (202). Mark Sanders makes the point that standing in for the other is both a basic expression of human foldedness, and, as it always is, a taking of the place of the other by a particular other, which is what necessitates the constant negotiation of who speaks for whom [\u2026] Folded into any act of representation or advocacy is an other-intendedness that makes it possible at once to portray and betray. (Complicities, 207) Malan\u2019s interruptions and interpretations, sincerely read, are both a basic expression of a kind of foldedness with Simon made profound only because it is advertised as the \u2018truth\u2019 and, inevitably, a betrayal in the sense that Simon is, once more, reduced to a largely English, largely white audience. Attempting to negotiate portrayal and betrayal, as well as the pitfalls of interpretation and (translated, legal) representation, Malan travels to Empangeni \u2013 where Simon was born \u2013 to try and understand more of the \u2018truth\u2019 about the Hammerman. He discovers the story of a boy cast out from society on account of the incest committed by his grandparents, spoken of as if he were the \u201cliving dead, as one who \u201cnever became human\u201d (Heart, 207). Sanders argues that \u201cone\u2019s human-being depends on a relation to an other and thus involves an affectual and ethical dimension, which, as Fanon notes, can be actualized or destroyed in the structure of linguistic address\u201d (Complicities, 183). To understand why one might be excluded from such human-being for the sins of one\u2019s forebears, Malan starts Simon\u2019s story over again, \u201cfrom the very beginning, as all stories must be told\u201d (Heart, 209), requiring that \u201cwe talk of the ancestors\u201d (212). They \u201care that close, that omnipresent\u201d (212). In Simon\u2019s culture, the ancestors are quite literal, experienced, and immanent embodiments of Sanders\u2019 \u201cmore or less transcendental figure[s] of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 98) required to negotiate the aporia inherent in the structure of true responsibility. In this sense, they (also quite literally) regulate entry into the category \u2018human-being\u2019, preventing people like Simon \u2013 who is an \u201cabomination\u201d (211) due to his incestuous grandparents \u2013 from attaining full personhood. After meeting various members of Simon\u2019s family, Malan asks: \u201cSo what was the truth of Simon?\u201d (222), eventually conceding that These were facts, not myths, although what freight they carried I could not say. I was deaf in Simon\u2019s language, and blind in his culture. In the end, all I really understood of Simon was that terrible scream [\u2026] I understood it because it was couched in the universal language of human pain. (224) Though he cannot understand what is at stake in such facts, the \u2018universal language of pain\u2019 Malan identifies is also alluded to by Antjie Krog, who would make Nomonde Calata\u2019s tears into the \u201csignature cry\u201d (Country, 43) of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998. Carli Coetzee, amongst many others, has noted the problems inherent in such universalising claims, arguing (quite validly) that they turn the body, specifically bodies like those of Nomonde Calata, into \u201ca cathartic symbol of a supposedly national myth\u201d, which constitutes more of a betrayal than a portrayal (\u201cThey Never Wept\u201d, 2000: 5). In the same way, using a real person like Simon Mpungose\u2019s story as a means to anything, no matter how valuable it may seem, will always imply a strong element of betrayal. There is, in a sense, no answer to this conundrum other than to point out, again, that it is the possibility of manipulation or betrayal which makes concepts like sincerity meaningful, responsible and response-able. As Adam Kelly explains, \u201cthe two poles become interminably entangled in any action, and we can never know for certain [\u2026] if any single event of giving or receiving is the genuine article or not\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 139). Even if Malan and his readers are deaf in Simon\u2019s language and cannot tell apart the poles of betrayal and portrayal, or truth and its performance; there is still a lesson to be learnt, a lesson that can be learnt: \u201cin [South Africa], white men assumed that they were the centre of the black universe \u2013 that they had subjugated the dreams and psyches of Africans, along with their bodies. It simply wasn\u2019t true. That is what Simon taught me\u201d (Heart, 235). It is a deeply profound lesson to learn, especially in the late 1980\u2019s, when South Africa was at its most violent and murderous. Moreover, the end of Malan\u2019s book in fact overturns exactly the white man\u2019s assumption, as Neil Alcock ascends (via a spirit stick) into the realm of death \u2013 and the immanent ancestors \u2013 hopefully to guide his people back home to a place where they can assert responsibility and foldedness in human-being: \u2018Neil, he was same like a black man. The skin was white, but the heart it was same like a black\u2019 [\u2026] They stood over the spot where their white brother was slain, and invited his spirit to enter their sacred stick. \u2018Numzaan,\u2019 they said, \u2018we have come to fetch you. Come, let us go home\u2019 [\u2026] The horns were a reminder of the ceremony performed that day, a sign that the household within had honoured its shades [\u2026] Aeons after our ancestors walked away, the first white man had come home to stay. (424-5) These final words carry a strong sense of the performative, mimicking the ceremony that has been carried out to cleanse and honour Neil\u2019s house \u2013 a symbol of how he and Creina are \u201cthe only white people who lived beyond all suspicion of complicity\u201d (342) \u2013 and yet they return Neil (via a textual staging) to his place amongst the immanent ancestors who are honoured on a day-to-day basis in acts intended to advance the truly valuable in human life, like love, trust, faith, and responsibility. To me, that is enough to risk betrayal and encourage sincere writing, reading, and listening once more.","title":"Rian Malan and Linguistic Address"},{"location":"academy/yours-sincerely/#country-of-my-skull-translation-and-singularity","text":"\u201cIt is language that shoots up like fire \u2013 wrought from a vision of where we must go and from a grip on where we are now\u201d (Country of My Skull, 230-1) Of all three writers I have chosen, Kelly\u2019s \u2018logic of anticipation\u2019 applies most directly to Antjie Krog and, more specifically, to her language(s) in that her work is premised on different kinds of translations: between languages, between races, and between generations. She confirmed, via email, that Country of My Skull (1998) [\u2026] was first written in Afrikaans and then translated by my son. I gave the first chapter to somebody with mothertongue english but found the text then too english to enter or change or own. it felt foreign. my son\u2019s text kept its Afrikaans underground and could be worked on. my engels was te swak om country te vertaal daardie tyd, so ook change of tongue. Begging is ook in Afrikaans geskryf maar my Engels is nou goed genoeg om nie-fiksie te vertaal. (ek dink). \u201cMy English was too weak to translate Country at the time [1997-8], as was the case with Change of Tongue [2003]. Begging [to be Black (2009)] was also written in Afrikaans, but my English is now good enough to translate nonfiction. (I think)\u201d. (Translation my own. 6 May 2015) Even casual communication is (at least) bilingual for Krog, though her admission that her English is weak is interesting given that Derek Attridge notes how \u201cmost Afrikaans writers have an excellent grasp of [English]\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 15). Krog\u2019s active (mis)use of languages, combined with her insistence that she \u201cwrites fiction bordering on fact while marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 2006: 106) results only in more questions. Why is nonfiction (especially work like hers, which uses poetry and \u2018fictional elements\u2019) easier to translate than fiction or poetry; does \u2018English that keeps its Afrikaans underground\u2019 suppress the original language or use it as a foundation; and how are we to understand any of her claims in the light of Kate Highman\u2019s revelations about the extent of \u201cplagiarism\u201d and \u201cventriloquism\u201d in Country (\u201cForging\u201d, 2015: 188)? And, if reading sincerely is a case of eliding the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance, does \u2018plagiarism\u2019 really amount to misuse? Starting with the second question, the word for \u2018keep to\u2019 in Afrikaans (in the sense of biblical commandments) is \u2018onderhoud\u2019 \u2013 which sounds very similar to \u2018underground\u2019 and is what I think Krog means in her email: her son\u2019s translation kept its Afrikaans grounding, hence she could work it over herself before publishing in English. In other words, the feeling of an other language (Afrikaans) at work beneath Country at once grounds the text and undermines it in the sense that something is always, as Attridge says, \u201clost in translation\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 17). Moreover, when switching between languages or highlighting (for instance) that she can only ever write the \u201ctrth or turth\u201d (Country, 54) Krog seems \u2013 if anything \u2013 actively to encourage singular readings which are as sincere, anticipatory and performative as the claim that the writer cannot actually write \u2018truth\u2019 in a nonfiction text. \u201cSingularity is not universal or transcendent,\u201d Derek Attridge explains, but it is what \u201cthe artist, often without being fully aware of how it is happening, is able to apprehend and articulate by reforming and revising the forces that are excluding it\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 10). Unfortunately, some of Krog\u2019s revisions seem to take on their own exclusionary nature (see the adapted testimony of Johannes Lekotse and Highman\u2019s analysis of it (\u201cForging\u201d, 198)), but she is able to apprehend and articulate various kinds of \u2018trth\u2019 and \u2018turth\u2019 without ever actually claiming that what she writes is entirely authentic. Putting aside the question of authenticity in nonfiction appears to allow for what Attridge calls singularities \u201cthat can be encountered rather than [those] which [are] completely inaccessible to thought or feeling\u201d (2). Such encounters range from the second-person, chilling narration of moments like the one involving Debbie Good (Heart, 182), or the fragrant anthem Krog hears between the suffering at the TRC (Country, 328), or the collaborative, de-signed dialogue of The Number and Three Letter Plague to come. Attridge argues that singularity shares, in particular, a great many features with Derrida\u2019s concept of iterability: a \u2018literary\u2019 work \u2013 or a signature \u2013 is \u201cirreducibly singular [\u2026] yet its singularity only has purchase outside itself, and is only intelligible, because it is repeatable\u201d (3). Just as the experience of this life is simultaneously uniquely yours and common to every being, singularities are unique moments of sincere personal response to a text that nevertheless contain some ineffable, universal thing. For instance, I think it not utterly preposterous to claim that nearly one\u2019s entire critical appreciation of Krog\u2019s text comes down to the singular decision of you the reader to entertain seriously her (deeply problematic) claim that she can write a narrative \u201cfor every black victim with an Afrikaner surname on their lips\u201d (Country, dedication). Kate Highman rejects this claim, and with good reason. She argues that there is a tension in Krog\u2019s writing \u2013 and thought \u2013 between \u201cspecific black voices\u201d and \u201cthe generic black voice,\u201d noting that \u201cauthorship in Country is highly unstable \u2013 words are repeatedly re-ascribed away from their contexts and re-assigned\u201d (\u201cForging\u201d, 188). Through a careful and detailed analysis of Krog\u2019s sources (acknowledged and unacknowledged), Highman argues that there are too many notable elisions between \u2018my real\u2019 and \u2018the real\u2019 in Country, which means that Krog\u2019s \u201cultimate accountability is to her own authorial self [\u2026] rather than to a reader or unspecified addressee or other\u201d (203). Certainly, there are extremely worrying contradictions in both Krog\u2019s writing and thought. Though she argues, in response to her critics, that the \u201cimagination is active in the narrative discourse, not in inventing reality\u201d (\u201cI, me, me mine!\u201d, 106), she invents (predominantly black) figures like Professor Kondlo and conversations with people, like the journalist after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela\u2019s hearing at the TRC (\u201cForging\u201d, 195-9). She adds to, edits and otherwise changes four essential pieces of testimony used to frame her whole narrative in ways which she actively seeks to hide by placing the fragments in quotation marks (189-95). She plagiarises intellectuals like Elaine Scarry, Ariel Dorfman, Pierre Bourdieu, and Julian Pitt-Rivers without acknowledging them, and often elides or over-simplifies key distinctions in their thought, ostensibly in pursuit of the kind of language which shoots up like fire, with both a vision of where \u2018we\u2019 could get to and a firm grip on where \u2018we\u2019 are now (Country, 230-1). Admittedly, Krog lifts large passages without acknowledgement, and adapts them in ways which are not true to their original context (\u201cForging\u201d, 196-8). However, the elision she makes (for instance) between honour=virtue and honour=precedent, which is so important to Pitt-Rivers\u2019 argument (198), does not necessarily amount to misuse precisely because authorship is so unstable in the text. It is not at all clear whose \u2018honour\u2019 is at stake, so whether that honour is properly represented is less important than the way it is intended to be read in the context of performing the \u2018truth\u2019 and anticipating suspicious readings even as detailed and nuanced as Highman\u2019s. For instance, when Krog publishes some of her mother\u2019s essays as part of Country, which read: \u201cI prayed that my hand should fall off if I ever write something for my personal honour at the cost of my people\u201d (Country, 98) it becomes impossible to tell quite whose honour the text is referring to; Krog\u2019s, her mother\u2019s, her family\u2019s, her tribe\u2019s, her race\u2019s, etc. This is complicated further by the fact that the original text was translated from Afrikaans by her son, so might not his \u2018honour\u2019 also be brought into question? Whatever the reader\u2019s decision, it is clear that Krog\u2019s \u201cultimate accountability\u201d cannot only be to her \u201cauthorial self\u201d (\u201cForging\u201d, 203), when that self is so utterly impossible to untangle from the various generations and translations responsible for the text of Country of My Skull in its totality. Furthermore, it is not at all clear whether publishing an originally Afrikaans essay in English constitutes an actual (rather than a merely linguistic) betrayal of her mother\u2019s intention and language or not. There is certainly more than enough evidence to suggest that Krog\u2019s decision to publish in English constitutes a self-conscious betrayal of the blood-lined identity of her family\u2019s language: How do I live with the fact that all the words used to humiliate, all the orders given to kill, belonged to language of my heart? At the hearings, many of the victims faithfully reproduced these parts of their stories in Afrikaans as proof of the bloody fingerprints on them. (238) However, it is possible \u2013 via Krog\u2019s unique and idiosyncratic mechanisms of distortion \u2013 that, in translating her mother\u2019s essay (along with the whole text), she might be betraying her inherited linguistic structures while staying true to the meaning of the words; for is the project of Country not precisely to write something for (all) her people, whom she so desperately wants to believe are both black and white, paying (instead of betraying) with her health, her relationships, and her sense of anything like a stable authorial self, which is to say, with her \u2018sanity\u2019? Rather than merely criticising Krog for betraying body\u2019s like Nomonde Calata\u2019s, modern readers, \u2018in love with artifice\u2019 and seeking \u2018new ways to create the real\u2019, might also be attracted to the \u201clittle red light\u201d on the TRC microphones, \u201cthe ultimate symbol of the whole process: here the marginalised voice speaks to the public ear, the unspeakable is spoken \u2013 and translated \u2013 the personal story brought from the innermost depths of the individual binds us anew to the collective\u201d (359). Krog is actively employing a frame of paradox here \u2013 the unspeakable must always remain unspoken if it is to be \u2018truly\u2019 unspeakable, \u2018ultimate symbols\u2019 of a process as complex and multi-faceted as the TRC are extremely suspicious (even if sincere), and the marginalised voice cannot ever speak to the public ear without distortions which try to map or transform our individual experiences into collective truths. Krog is well aware of the contradictions though, as her essay-response to critics cited above suggests, so the big question really is: why still write in this manner? Perhaps it is because she actively seeks to implicate herself and stage her own complicity, so that her apology can become \u2018truly\u2019 meaningful in the mind of the reader. In order to do so, much like Malan, she adopts a number of different voices: dare I sit in this grape dark during this return journey where my body is overcome by grief my heart coagulate resigned write I \u2013 a blue slit against this all. . . (53) Later, another writing persona \u2013 this time a psychologist \u2013 explains that: \u201cIn my job there are, in a sense, no lies \u2013 all of it ties in, reacts to, plays upon the truth\u201d (117). These two passages seem to anticipate most of Highman\u2019s objections, for every lie \u2018plays upon\u2019 the truth, while the poet sits contemplating darkness and grief, only to write I, which is no more than a shifting blue slit, simultaneously against \u2013 and constitutive \u2013 of \u2018this all\u2019. Country of My Skull ends with another poem: [\u2026] I was scorched A new skin I am changed forever. I want to say: Forgive me Forgive me Forgive me You whom I have wronged, please Take me With you (423) The last three, fractured lines \u2013 in particular \u2013 represent a desire to apologise \u2018truly\u2019 that is primarily dialogic and affective. The \u2018I\u2019 will always betray the \u2018you\u2019 in any attempt to portray that you, yet the two remain fundamentally constitutive of each other. Translated apology, which changes the \u2018I\u2019 forever, becomes Krog\u2019s way of signing in her own tune, of writing \u201csomething which responds or corresponds in an equally singular, which is to say irreducible, irreplaceable, \u2018new\u2019 way\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 5). Attridge explains that singularity, in the \u2018literary\u2019 sense, is \u201ca constellation made possible for both creator and reader by habits of interpreting, thinking, and feeling, inculcated in the course of an existence within a culture or cultures\u201d (7). Within this constellation, different versions of the \u2018trth or turth\u2019 can exist without necessarily contradicting one another, instead bringing readers to a point where the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance is less important than deciding which \u2018truth\u2019 seems most applicable and what this might suggest about the reader\u2019s relationship to \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 in general. Krog, in particular, seems fine with literally inventing some characters and, though the fact that they are black is particularly forced and problematic, Mark Sanders makes the point that It is precisely this element of invention that, along with its active acknowledgement, has the potential to bring a dimension of responsibility to the management of transition. [\u2026] when that past is understood as invented, it can yield a structure of ongoing responsibility rather than a remedy meant to work once and for all. (Complicities, 127) Country of My Skull , regrettably, lacks a large part of the sort of \u2018active acknowledgement\u2019 that Sanders refers to, which means that Highman\u2019s argument remains valid. However, there are certain moments that she misses on account of the hermeneutics of suspicion she employs, moments in which Krog\u2019s signature tune strikes too deep a chord to be dismissed as mere plagiarism. Attridge argues that singularity \u201cmust partake of generality or universality: the signature must use the inscription codes of a particular language\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 4). Quoting an interview of his with Derrida, he explains that \u201cto become readable, [signatures of \u2018literary\u2019 works] have to be divided, to participate and belong. Then it [\u2026] takes its part in the genre, the type, the context, the meaning [\u2026] it loses itself to offer itself (4). In that Country was written in Afrikaans, but published in English first, it is, by its very nature, already-divided between languages. Being already-divided means that the text can participate in (at least) two cultural contexts (Afrikaans and South African English), and at least three genres: \u2018fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u2019 in the attempt to make \u201cthese narratives alone enough to justify the existence of the Truth Commission. Because [\u2026] people can no longer indulge in their separate dynasties of denial\u201d (Country, 134). The ultimate success, such as it may be, of Krog\u2019s work lies in the passages that are not written as a white, or a black (or \u2018the black\u2019), or a poet, or a psychologist, or a man, or a woman, but by a human-being who was \u201cmade to write this story\u201d (54), another performance to be believed, or not; And I wonder: God. Does he hear us? Does He know what our hearts are yearning for? That we all just want to be human \u2013 some with more colour, some with less, but all with air and sun. And I wade into song \u2013 in a language that is not mine, in a tongue I do not know. It is fragrant inside the song, and among the keynotes of sorrow and suffering there are soft silences where we who belong to this landscape, all of us, can come to rest. Sometimes the times we live in overflow with light. (328) As with Simon\u2019s bellow, you can almost hear the fragrant and idiosyncratic tune, even if it is inevitably distorted by Krog\u2019s contradictions and downright dishonesties. It is in a strange language, and it is full of suffering and sorrow, but there is a sense of belonging in it, of the kind of peace attained by Neil Alcock. From between the endless lines of sorrow and death and all \u2018the ways in which we killed one another\u2019, floats the suggestion of a fragrant time overflowing with light, premised on the keynote of human-being, \u2018universal\u2019 suffering, and foldedness this entails. The possibility that the expression of such foldedness might be true, again, seems worth the risk of betraying the human beings and their stories which the sincere author seeks to portray.","title":"Country of My Skull, Translation and Singularity"},{"location":"academy/yours-sincerely/#jonny-steinberg-and-ontological-designing","text":"\u201cTo assimilate truth piece by piece\u201d ( Country of My Skull , 193) Steinberg, Malan, and Krog have all appeared on panel discussions together, the most recent entitled \u201cIn a Place Where You Couldn\u2019t Make This Shit Up\u201d, at the 2010 Cape Town Book Fair. While each wrote/writes at a unique and specific time, their work shares many similarities, chief among them the fact that, though the marketing of a work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019 sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of I=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within their texts complicates each telling. Malan pleaded with \u2018visionary readers\u2019 in the late 1980\u2019s to see the ways in which South Africans were killing each other and to seek, instead, a different kind of love: \u2018You said one could be deformed by this country, and yet it seems to me one can only be deformed by the things one does to oneself [\u2026] The only thing you can do is love, because it\u2019s the only thing which leaves light inside you, instead of total, obliterating darkness.\u2019 (Heart, 409) The \u2018you\u2019 here actually refers to Malan, who is listening to Creina Alcock speak. The shifting pronouns allow \u201cthe truly valuable in human life\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 135) to exist for a moment without irony, rendered sincerely through the voice of an other, an I-who-is-not-the-writer, while the writer and the reader become essentially indistinguishable as the you who is addressed. Krog (and her son) translate her own and other\u2019s work (as well as, problematically, adapting testimony to suit her own ends) which is to say she stages her own complicity in acts of plagiarism and (mis)appropriation, but insists on being read in a bilingual, impure, performative context of \u201cfact bordering on fiction but marketing it as nonfiction\u201d (\u201cI, me, me, mine!\u201d, 106). In addition to the psychologist, or the apologetic poet, Krog also inserts the voices of others into the narrative, from her mother\u2019s essays to the student from Ladybrand, whose poem Krog leaves in Afrikaans, and then translates into English on the opposite page (Country, 316-7). The final, circular couplet sums up how I read the intention of Krog\u2019s multilingual, multigenerational text, in that it captures the attempt to hear the various voices at work in the text, to see the value in the mere fact that the narrative even exists: \u201cas jy gesien het/ het jy vir altyd gesien\u201d (316). As already noted, Steinberg acknowledges in his first book that \u201cI am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and I am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. I announce up front that I will not tell you how the material was gathered\u201d (Midlands, 218). He self-consciously places his authorial self by virtue of his skin colour and the line of (white) writers of which he is a part, while simultaneously setting his (ethnographic) methodology apart from those who have come before him. It is important that one of the defining characteristics he identifies in his predecessors is \u2018failure\u2019. In a sense, white South African writing can only be dialogic and affective, it can only anticipate an other\u2019s response, precisely by failing; by performing believably the human failure of its own \u2018traitorous heart\u2019. If it does so, such nonfiction might have the potential, like nothing as experienced a reader and writer as Salman Rushdie has \u201cread before\u201d, to express \u201cthe demotic voice of black and Afrikaner South Africa\u201d (Heart, Introductory Note, emphasis added). Steinberg seems to feel, from his first book, that he owes \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (xi) to his subjects. However, instead of irony, translation, and (mis)appropriation, he attempts to create a more open and honest sense of collaboration aimed at collapsing the distinction between \u2018truth\u2019 and its performance entirely. As Twidle notes of his \u201cflat [\u2026] character-driven prose\u201d (\u201cIn a Place\u201d, 10), Steinberg quite literally collaborates with people like Magadien Wentzel or Sizwe Magadla to produce works like The Number (2004) and Three Letter Plague (2009), but I think the way he designs his research and the resultant texts goes far deeper than these collaborations. In all his work, Steinberg actively acknowledges both the readers, critics, and intellectuals who helped him, from Mark Gevisser and Anthony Altbeker, to Ivan Vladislavi\u010d \u2013 \u201cfrom whose experience and perspicacity [Steinberg] benefited three times in a row\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 390) \u2013 as well as the institutions which funded and supported his research. From the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, to the Development Corporation Ireland (The Number, vii), all are faithfully and openly acknowledged as having played a role in the overall design of each work. These acknowledgements may seem like staples of a certain kind of ethnographic, academic research and texts. However, Anne-Marie Willis explains that \u2018ontological designing\u2019 \u2013 i.e. self-consciously creating different \u2018ways of knowing\u2019 \u2013 is \u201ca theory: that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; that designing is fundamental to being human \u2014 we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings \u2014 in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e.,through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); that this adds up to a double movement \u2014 we design our world, while our world acts back [\u2026] and designs us.\u201d (80) Acknowledging one\u2019s sources is certainly not unique to Steinberg, but the point here is that openly designing and honestly discussing the ways in which one comes to \u2018know\u2019 something adds a further element of responsibility to nonfiction texts by showing them to be divided (between different character\u2019s interpretations, different reader\u2019s opinions, and different institution\u2019s requirements) and therefore allowing them to \u2018participate in and belong to\u2019 various different contexts and \u2018realities\u2019 (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 4). Ontological designing is also an extension of Kelly\u2019s logic: we anticipate other\u2019s reactions in such a way that \u201cinner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic\u201d (\u201cSincerity\u201d, 136) and, in the same way (although applied not just to others, but practices and objects as well) \u201cwe design our world, while our world acts back [\u2026] and designs us\u201d (\u201cDesigning\u201d, 80). Steinberg\u2019s carefully researched, ethnographic, character-driven prose shows how anticipatory logic can be used not only to negotiate irony (like Malan) or complicity (like Krog), but actively to design textual spaces in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside momentarily so as to consider the possibilities believing any given performance might allow. \u201cIt occurred to me that of all the motives that propelled Magadien to cooperate so enthusiastically with the writing of this book, this was the most important: he wanted to rescue his history from the tongues of others\u201d (The Number, 371). Here is another example of a frame of paradox: the implication that Magadien might be able to rescue his history from the tongues of others is only accessible through, or legible because of, the pen of exactly such a white, English-speaking, upper-middle-class other. But this is also exactly the point; Steinberg\u2019s is just a pen, The Number just a book, which is to say that it is concerned with \u201cartifice [\u2026] and new means of creating the \u2018real\u2019\u201d (Reality, 4). In understanding the \u2018real\u2019 \u2013 in this case, a space where Magadien has rescued his story from the tongues of others \u2013 as fundamentally created, readers can self-consciously choose whether to believe the persona \u2018Jonny Steinberg\u2019 and his collaborators (Sizwe and Magadien at the level of characters, Vladislavi\u0107 and Altbeker at the level of readers, the CSVR etc. at the level of institutions), or not. I suggest that Jonny Steinberg\u2019s work takes the logic of anticipation and applies it with a \u201cradically different understanding of how modern subjects are and come to be who/what we are in the modern world\u201d (\u201cOntological Designing, 2006: 80). We can re-read an earlier quotation, sentence for sentence, in the context of ontological designing: I shut up. The subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the \u2018I\u2019 up. But he had, of course, told the \u2018I\u2019 precisely what every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear. He had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. The victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (The Number, 242) The first sentence represents an assertion of unbridled agency on the writing persona\u2019s part \u2013 he actively shuts up and creates a silent world. However, this is complicated by the next two sentences, written from a perspective outside the I-who-writes, which suggest that it is not the \u2018I\u2019 who shut up, but rather the subject the \u2018I\u2019 was in dialogue with who shut that \u2018I\u2019 up. Furthermore, it was, in fact, the subject who anticipated \u201cwhat every \u2018I\u2019 wants to hear\u201d, rather than the other way around. The perspective then shifts back to within the I-who-writes, but no longer does he engage in bald and uncomplicated assertions of agency. Rather, he expresses the nuanced sort of acknowledgement which could potentially collapse the distinction between truth and its performance: the \u2018victory\u2019 (that is, the licence to portray the \u2018heart\u2019 and \u2018soul\u2019 of an other) remains, inevitably, the (believably) anxious writing persona\u2019s. To reiterate, in the context of textual spaces in which \u201cwe are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed\u201d (\u201cDesigning, 80), the logic of anticipation works two ways. Though the \u2018I\u2019 is unable to transcend the kind of betrayal that representational \u2018victory\u2019 always implies, Steinberg seems to have created a space where the subject\u2019s words anticipate what he, as the writing persona \u2018I\u2019, needs to hear. And it is not just him, but every \u2018I\u2019, every writing (and reading) persona within the text. This is achieved both through the way Steinberg openly interacts with the characters (who are also real people, although their real names are not given), readers (both \u2018the reader\u2019 of his text, and \u2018real\u2019 people like Gevisser, Altbeker etc.) and institutions which make up his textual environment. By showing actively how he has designed this textual environment, Steinberg simultaneously reveals how the environment, also, designs his texts. We are no longer speaking only of writing and reading sincerely so as to elide the distinction between truth and its performance, in search of different possibilities for meaning and the expression of the \u2018truly valuable in human life\u2019. Ontological designing is about creating singular works which actively collapse truth and its performance in order to get at \u2018something more than truthfulness\u2019. In The Number , this something seems primarily to have to do with how one chooses to name things. \u201cHe has always understood the power of this mask [\u2026] it is William, but it cannot possibly be William\u201d (299) Steinberg explains, showing how the character \u2018Magadien\u2019, too, shifts between various identities that he self-consciously creates for himself. Earlier in the text, Steinberg questions Magadien about how much really hinges on a name, to which the subject takes offense: \u201cMy life goes round in these circles. You ask why a name is so important. I am telling you why. I need to be Magadien Wentzel to live a proper life\u2019\u201d (31). Here, again, we have both writer and reader addressed as \u2018you\u2019 in dialogue with a character in the text. The writer\u2019s (and reader\u2019s) question is answered \u2013 is anticipated by \u2013 Magadien, who is always in the process of telling, in the process of revealing aspects of his identity the writing persona cannot, actually, claim full \u2018victory\u2019 over. Here, the subject speaks as \u2018I\u2019 and is, again, able to anticipate the writing persona\u2019s questions, to exercise his own agency in terms of how he is read and understood. Ultimately, Magadien\u2019s obsession with naming is revealed to stem from his need to have \u201cthe truth written on my grave\u201d (92). Again then, the reader is confronted by the impossibility of true responsibility before anything but the \u201cmore or less transcendental figure of alterity\u201d (Complicities, 98) which is embodied by death, or more specifically here, \u2018my grave\u2019. The appeal to death as originary of a different kind of responsibility (and collaboration) is a pattern which gets repeated in greater detail in Steinberg\u2019s following work, Three Letter Plague , which is, again, radically open about its own \u201cuniquely intimate, uniquely intrusive\u201d structure (2009: 183). Although very different from Magadien, the persona labeled \u2018Sizwe\u2019 is also no more than his own, unique \u201cassemblage of paradoxes\u201d (47), acting as an \u201cinterpreter-subject\u201d in a text often written using the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d (247). Sizwe\u2019s becomes a story of identifying with the dying and dead in strange \u2013 but often surprisingly innovative and courageous \u2013 ways given his context; while he remains living on his own, uniquely flawed, terms. Sizwe looked into Jake\u2019s dying face and saw himself. For a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved. Who lay on the bed and who stood up healthy and strong was merely a question of chance. It was an unusual moment, one that embodied an attitude to AIDS that Sizwe would struggle to re-create in time to come. For it is not an easy thing identifying with the dying and the dead. Among our deepest responses to them is an unacknowledged feeling of triumph. (30-1) Truthfully, how could the writing persona ever know what Sizwe saw when he looked into Jake\u2019s dying face, and is it not deeply offensive to assume he could? My proposition is that reading sincerely and actively designing a singular response to (collaborative) performances aimed at \u2018dissolving boundaries\u2019 \u2013 or writing the truth on \u2018my grave\u2019 \u2013 does not make universalising or generalising assumptions like the above any less problematic or narcissistic. However, by the end of the passage, through a seemingly heartfelt acknowledgement that it is no easy thing to identify with the dying and dead, the writing persona shifts to the pronoun \u2018our\u2019. And so what if this \u2018our\u2019 is the fictional result of problematic generalisation? If white South African nonfiction writers insist upon writing \u2018fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction\u2019, then does it not seem almost noble (and a little tragic), that the pronoun \u2018our\u2019 is the element of fiction they would use \u201cto enable our facts to arrive at the truth\u201d ( I\u2019, me, me, mine!\u201d, 101)? The element for which writers are willing to take almost any kind of artistic risk, from adopting and adapting the voices of others, translating their own (and other\u2019s work), plagiarising, misappropriating, shifting between pronouns, dissolving boundaries and designing dialogue which de-signs their own ability to represent their subjects? Claiming the ability to anticipate others\u2019 reactions necessarily implies an element of narcissism and egoism, to which all that can be said is that sincerity, too, depends on the possibility of manipulation and \u2013 indeed \u2013 it is precisely this possibility which renders the idea meaningful at all. Attridge\u2019s concept of the \u2018singularity\u2019 of literary works has always depended on the reader, or \u201chuman translator\u201d, and their singular \u201cdecision\u201d which attempts to stay faithful to \u201cthe singularizing event\u201d (\u201cSingularity\u201d, 17-8). The whole point of advertising work as \u2018nonfiction\u2019, or of adopting a logic of anticipation, or of designing ontologies within any given text, is to allow for and encourage the \u201chuman translator\u201d to create or de-sign their own response to the singular events surrounding each text. Rather than question authenticity, each reader, therefore, ought to ask of each performance which interpretation, which unacceptable decision, seems most \u2018true\u2019 to them and what this might imply about their own relationship to \u2018reality\u2019 and the \u2018truth\u2019, both as an individual and as part of a collective \u2013 that is \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018South African\u2019.","title":"Jonny Steinberg and Ontological Designing"},{"location":"academy/yours-sincerely/#conclusion","text":"\u201cPerhaps, in the end, that was Hermann\u2019s gift to Lusikisiki [\u2026] people who had come to see, through the potency of their own deeds, that the horizon of the possible stretched further than they had ever imagined\u201d (Three Letter Plague, 328). This, I would argue, is primarily what Steinberg\u2019s ethnographic methodology is aimed at expressing: just how potent anyone\u2019s own deeds can be in terms of creating or designing the ways in which we read and translate (performances of) the \u2018truth\u2019, whether it is as writer, reader, \u2018real\u2019 person, or character. More generally, though the marketing of nonfiction sets up a superficial relationship of I=writer, and you=reader, the ways pronouns shift within all the supposedly \u2018true\u2019 texts I have chosen above is used by all three writers to create dialogic and affective texts in which the distinction between truth and its performance is not as important, perhaps, as deciding \u2013 in the way of a singular \u2018human translator attempting to stay true to the \u2018singularizing event\u2019 \u2013 what kinds of meaning are to be found by believing the marketing claims and reading sincerely (which is also to perform in a certain way).

However, by asserting \u2018our\u2019 own complicity, or by actively designing and de-signing textual spaces, both writers and readers can negotiate the distinction between truth and its performance and seek, instead, \u201csomething more than truthfulness\u201d (Midlands, 218). This something, I suggest, has the same indescribable, ineffable structure as Attridge\u2019s \u2018singularity\u2019, though it can be said to originate not only in death, but also in love: \u201cHis love is of course selfish: it is his progeny, and no one else, for whom he wakes up in the mornings.

It was on science and perspective and beauty. His name is Frank Wilczek. He spoke slowly, with long pauses between thoughts as if trying to fit his hard-won truth into less than two hours was a task the difficulty of which few mortals could conceive, let alone complete. And yet, a grand picture emerged between all the slow sentences, as if the ineffable could be spoken of, could be sidled up to using pure symbol and just one question, sculpted from the lumps of rough stone we find strewn along our way through this one wild and precious life. Does nature embody beautiful ideas? Like all great queries, it is its simplicity that acts as a key capable of unlocking doors you didn\u2019t know were there. Five everyday words \u2013 worker words with blue collars, blurted out by just about anybody \u2013 can be used to build an artifice, a work of art, that will let you gaze in wonder at the never-ending pattern which plays across our mind each day. Numbering the Harmonies This version of the story starts with Pythagoras, who believed that All Things Are Number , because he managed to show how not only shape (in the case of triangles), but also length and tension (in the case of musical strings) are related through number to harmony. The world of mind and the world of matter influence one another, profoundly, and this was already enough \u2013 more than 2,000 years ago \u2013 to anchor a mystical worldview. The Greeks, however, were not able to answer the inevitable follow-up to Pythagoras\u2019 discoveries, namely; why do musical notes in ratios of small whole numbers sound beautiful to us humans? Well, by mapping the inner ear and casting our brain as a pattern prediction engine which experiences accurate forecasts as aesthetically pleasing, we can understand better our perception of sound. We can slip into the spaces between and hear that what we experience as beautiful are simply sounds which are predictable, i.e. those whose frequencies are in ratios of small whole numbers. Spiritual Science Of course \u2013 for the ancient Greeks \u2013 science and spirituality were not separate fields of study. E. O. Wilson calls this the \"Ionian Dream\" in his wonderful book \"Consilience\" - which is alaos well worth reading. In truth, every one of the greatest scientific minds since Pythagoras has entertained this same unificatory dream in some manner, and all of them - without fail - have pointed to some greater pattern behind what their work itself reveals. Newton is perhaps the best example: he was a deeply devout man, and yet his devotion was not the result of magical thinking: it was a consequence of the method of Analysis and Synthesis that he put forward most eloquently in Principia . It\u2019s worth repeating for emphasis: his devotion was not the result of his spirituality and, like, what he wanted to manifest; it was a consequence of his scientific view of the world. Through some of the most visionary, critical, and rational thinking ever conducted, Newton was brought to deeper insights about the nature of both himself, and the world of which he was a part. \u201cI do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\u201d \u201cFor so far as we can know by natural Philosophy what is the first Cause; what Power he has over us, and what benefits we receive from him, so far our Duty toward him, as well as that toward one another, will appear to us by the Light of Nature. And no doubt, if the Worship of false Gods had not blinded the Heathen, their moral Philosophy would have gone farther than to the four Cardinal Virtues; and instead of teaching the Transmigration of Souls, and to worship the Sun and Moon, and dead Heroes, they would have taught us to worship our true Author and Benefactor, as their Ancestors did under the Government of Noah and his Sons before they corrupted themselves.\u201d Newton was not, as so many pop-science writers would have you believe in a lazy turn of phrase, \u201cbrought to the edge of rationality\u201d and therefore forced into a faith-based leap into the unknown. He was shown that there is no end to rational thought; no possibility of ever actually reaching the boundary between this and oneness. It is a vital distinction: his is a faith built on the wonder of endless permutations of what is, not a faith built on some supposed bound to rational enquiry and its demand that we believe in the inexplicable. The same goes for Plato, Euclid, Galileo, Copernicus, Leibniz, Kepler, Maxwell, Faraday, Einstein, Bohr, Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Noether, Jeans, Sagan, Feynman, Levin and countless other scientists who are, at heart, some of the deepest and most sincere \u201cbelievers\u201d in history. The Work Will Teach You How To Do It Kepler in his younger days, imagining the revolution of planets to be ruled by the spacing between five platonic solids, once wrote: \u201cGod himself was too kind to remain idle, and began to play the game of signatures, signing his likeness into the world; therefore I chance to think that all nature and the graceful sky are symbolized in the art of geometry.\u201d Of course, the work taught him that his model was wrong; the planets revolve along more complicated ellipses. However, for staying true to observation, Lady Science granted him three laws of planetary motion on top of which Newton would later stand, held still to the ground by the kindness of gravity. Kepler knew that God was still playing the game of signatures; it was just that the tune was signed far deeper than he had ever dreamed (though that did not make his sky any less graceful, his art any less geometric). Most interestingly, the Ideal world of Platonic solids played a big role in the development of Kepler\u2019s very Real laws. This would have no doubt pleased Plato, because the primary search for beauty was pretty much his ding an sig . He argued that there was a realm of Ideas (or Ideals), which was eternal and unchanging and provided the source of all we can name. Though limiting, it is also the source of our liberation. In a dialogue between Socrates and Glaucon in the Republic where they talk about The Cave, he has Socrates describe liberation as an active process of learning and engagement so as to live in awareness of the Ideal behind the Real. Science, looked at through this historical lense, can best be described as the incremental (con)fusion \u2013 based on observation \u2013 of the Real with the Ideal. Wilczek sums it up well: \u201cAlong the inward path, we examine our concepts critically, and try to strip them of the dross of mere appearance, to reach their ideal (i.e. Ideal) meaning. This is the path of philosophy and metaphysics. Along the outward path, we engage appearances critically, and try to strip them of complications, to find their hidden essence. This is the way of science and physics [and the] outward path does in fact lead to liberation.\u201d Critically Acclaimed What consecrates itself as common to liberation through either concepts or appearances is a critical approach. However, the kind of criticism used to engage concepts is what we call constructive , in that the meaning such criticism attempts to reveal is always-already a human affair. Criticism which engages appearance is called deconstructive , because it attempts to reduce down the whole event, via analysis and synthesis, so as to find its \u201chidden essence\u201d. Paradoxically, it\u2019s the deconstructionists who can impact the real world reliably. Observing appearances, trying to measure what causes them, and reasoning about the general laws which govern such behaviour leads as surely to technological development as it did to Kepler\u2019s or Newton\u2019s reductionist wonder. On that note, \u201creductionist\u201d has unfortunately become a dirty word, which seems unfair. Reducing complexity into simpler parts is an incredibly powerful way to think which made its appearance long after myth or narrative in the evolutionary development of human mind. We should not be so quick to discard it. After discussing the art of perspective drawing, its links to geometry, the discovery of vanishing points on the horizon, and the way such concepts enrich our experience of the Real, as well as our ability to describe it, Wilczek said: \u201cWhen I am alert to these things, my experience is fuller and more vivid. I hope you will find this happens for you too. Through disciplined imagination we transcend the Cave of ignorant sensation.\u201d Stumbling further out the cave with the hard-won ability to render, and therefore think critically about, different perspectives led inexorably to two very important questions: what does the same picture look like seen from other angles; and what remains the same no matter which perspective you adopt? Imagining Real Symmetries Both questions have fundamentally to do with symmetry , what Wilczek described that cold night in Oxford as \u201cChange Without Change.\u201d We know, for instance, that the laws of motion do not change whether you are standing still, or moving at a constant speed. This is called Galilean Translation Symmetry and lies at the heart of Einstein\u2019s Special Relativity. Of course, Einstein was not the first to make use of symmetries to discipline his imagination so that it might produce something which accurately describes the Real. Maxwell\u2019s equations for light display some of the most profound symmetry anywhere in mathematics, and the pattern they uncover has become the basis for describing both the strong and weak nuclear forces, too. The really beautiful thing about Change Without Change when we can capture it mathematically was perhaps summed up best by Heinrich Hertz (in a tribute to Maxwell): \u201cOne cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.\u201d You see, Maxwell\u2019s equations describe far more than just visible light. I\u2019m not sure how often you think of it this way, but they reveal how, to Wilczek\u2019s mind, \u201cRadio waves are just \u2018light\u2019 with a much longer wavelength, and lower frequency, than visible light. In other words, in radio waves the oscillations between electric and magnetic fields take place more gradually in space, and more slowly in time . Going from radio toward shorter wavelengths, we meet microwaves, infrared, the visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each of these many forms of \u2018light\u2019 has evolved from a purely theoretical construction \u2013 in other words, a dream \u2013 into a fountain of modern technology. They\u2019re all in Maxwell\u2019s equations.\u201d Maxwell showed the almost omnipotent power of thinking not just in terms of perspective , but also in terms of a conscious search for symmetry . Plato, again, would have been proud. In fact, Wilczek \u2013 at a half-whisper \u2013 continued, \u201cwe have learned to work from symmetry toward truth. Instead of using experiments to infer equations, and then finding (to our delight and astonishment) that the equations have a lot of symmetry, we propose equations with enormous symmetry and then check to see whether Nature uses them. It has been an amazingly successful strategy.\u201d God\u2019s Aesthetics It is only here, with a deep and critical understanding of symmetry that we can blur the line between theoretical construction and dream to catch a glimpse of what unifies seeming opposites; for what changes without change. Only now can we begin to speak of some kind of unified vision for both science and spirituality. But, as always, to speak of it would be to ruin it (because my sentences lack deep symmetry). Fittingly, Wilczek noted instead that the \u201cthemes of connection, symmetry, and light come together in the art of the mandala \u201d, providing this digitally-generated image as proof: Birth of the Son of God by R. Gopakumar We must, before turning to the next big developments in critical thought, let Maxwell himself have his say: \u201cHappy is the man who can recognize in the work of to-day a connected portion of the work of life and an embodiment of the work of Eternity. The foundations of his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of Infinity. He strenuously works out his daily enterprises because the present is given him for a possession. Thus ought man to be an impersonation of the divine process of nature, and to show forth the union of the infinite with the finite, not slighting his temporal existence, remembering that in it only is individual action possible, nor yet shutting out from his view that which is eternal, knowing that Time is a mystery which man cannot endure to contemplate until eternal Truth enlightens it.\u201d Back to the Quantum Future After a long sip of water and some considered silence, Wilczek set out into the quantum surf, which seems at first to herald the New Age, before crashing into a kind of chaotic beauty beyond what your average famous guru can comfortably contemplate. Basically, the core idea in the quantum world is that everything can be described by its wave function. This sounds cool, but there are three major points to be aware of: Working with wave functions yields probabilities, not definite answers. You don\u2019t get access to the wave function itself, only a peek at processed versions of it. Answering different questions may require processing the wave function in different, and mutually exclusive, ways. These, in turn, raise conceptual issues. The first raises the issue of determinism : is calculating probabilities really the best we can do? The second raises the issue of many worlds : what does the full wave function describe when we\u2019re not peeking; a gigantic expansion of reality, or is it just a mind tool, no more real than a dream? The third raises the issue of complementarity : which turns out to be both a feature of physical reality and a lesson in wisdom. The complementarity principle holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously, and was first described by Niels Bohr. Bohr had also done a bunch of work on the \u201cstationary states\u201d of atoms based on their absorption and emission spectra (back to light and connectivity), summing it up neatly with the idea that there was something of the \u201chighest musicality\u201d in how it all fit together. This is more than a nice way of speaking, because it turns out that the Schrodinger wave equation for an electron in an atom looks very similar to the equation for vibrations in a musical instrument first mentioned in relation to Pythagoras, the length and tension of strings, and the notion that All Things Are Number . Natural vibrations in musical instruments produce pleasing sounds; natural vibrations in an electron\u2019s wave function also turn out to mean something simple and appealing for its probability cloud \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change at all. Such solutions have the properties Bohr anticipated in his \u201cstationary states\u201d: the electron will persist in any of these patterns indefinitely, and no other patterns have that property. \u201cStatic states\u201d of a single-electron system, i.e. Hydrogen Harmonic patterns formed using different frequencies on a soundboard. They share deep similarities because the equations governing them have the same pattern or shape. Of course, as with everything in the quantum world, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. Not only do the building blocks of our universe consist of probabilities with a tendency to travel in ways which match the harmonies of musical instruments; those building blocks exist in vast numbers of identical copies, which neither evolve nor erode, nor, in a stable environment, display any properties that change in time. Looking back in history, thanks to the finite speed of light, we may see, through their spectra, that the atoms in galaxies a long time ago, and far far away, behave in the same way as the atoms we see on Earth today. If atoms are so stable and resistant to change, how did they arise in the first place? A lot of the above section is paraphrased from Wilczek\u2019s actual book, but remains as is for the \u201csake of rhythm\u201d. A Paradise Within Thee, Happier Farr Of course, Maxwell was alert to this conundrum, but only saw it is more evidence of benevolent Creation: \u201cNatural causes, as we know, are at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins, the molecules out of which these systems are built \u2013 the foundation stones of the material universe \u2013 remain unbroken and unworn. They continue to this day as they were created \u2013 perfect in number and measure and weight, and from the ineffaceable characters impressed on them we may learn that those aspirations after accuracy in measurement, truth in statement, and justice in action, which we reckon among our noblest attributes as men, are ours because they are essential constituents of the image of Him who in the beginning created, not only heaven and earth, but the materials of which heaven and earth consist.\u201d So, we end up in this weird situation where quantum mechanics brings discreteness and fixed, harmonic patterns into the description of continuous objects that obey dynamical equations. Though it\u2019s not obvious, these equations, which could not themselves impose structure, can still do so through focussing the power of other principles. That is, we can discipline our imaginations with the twin constraining powers of quantum mechanics and cosmology \u2013 using cosmology to explain the poverty of energy which \u2018encourages\u2019 atoms to seek stable states, and quantum mechanics to show how poverty of energy imposes structure. The challenge, of course, is to describe this all meaningfully to you , and after discussing the additional dimensions which would be required to draw the quantum state of an atom with two electrons (i.e. Helium), Wilczek noted that: \u201cWorthy images of atoms will share, in their mixture of regularity and variation, the qualities of mandalas. They will offer, too, an awe-inspiring perspective on the assertion at the heart of mystical spirituality: That Art Thou. Because, you know, it is.\u201d Beauty At The Core John Wheeler once summed up Einstein\u2019s General Relativity in the pithy couplet: Matter tells space-time how to curve. Space-time tells matter how to move. This turned out to be a little too poetic, though. Criticizing the term \u201cStandard Model\u201d for its connotations and opting instead for Core Theory , Wilczek is worth quoting at length on this one. \u201cIn the full Core Theory, including all four forces, matter has four kinds of properties: energy-momentum, electric charge, weak charge, and strong charge. Particles of matter propagate through a more complex space than Wheeler allowed for, which includes electromagnetic, weak, and strong property spaces atop ordinary space. But matter follows, according to the Core, the same yin principle, adapted to this more complex environment: Keep going as straight as you can! [\u2026] The wonder of the Core is that all forces sound like recognizable variations of the same theme. It does not seem to me overly fanciful, and it is certainly pretty, to see in the duality matter || space-time \u2026 an instance of the Chinese complementarity yin || yang\u201d The whole thing is self-similar across scales, and in all dimensions. This is what makes valid the claim that the weak and strong forces are based on the same exact pattern as Maxwell described for electromagnetic forces; it\u2019s just that they include extra property spaces, like spin and colour in addition to the charge we find in Maxwell\u2019s dreams. Though gravity presents something of a problem, all four can be neatly captured: \u201cAnd so, putting it all together: Energy-momentum tells space-time how to curve. Space-time tells energy-momentum what straight is (in space-time). And now comes the Core Theory of electromagnetism: Electric charge tells electromagnetic property space how to curve. Electromagnetic property space tells electric charge what straight is (in electromagnetic property space) And of the weak force: Weak charge tells weak property space how to curve. Weak property space tells weak charge what straight is (in weak property space) And of the strong force: Strong charge tells strong property space how to curve. Strong property space tells strong charge what straight is (in strong property space) The soul of the Core, from this perspective, is yin-yang, four times over. Take another moment to reflect on this simply beautiful complexity. Wilczek continues to come back to this phrase \u201cwhat straight is\u201d. Doesn\u2019t that sound just like a synonym for the Middle Way? Covariance and Collisions It\u2019s getting late, and Frank\u2019s talk is showing no signs of slowing up, but stick with me here. This is where it really counts. If we cast the Four Laws as we have above, we are met with a very concrete challenge, namely: how do we get equations for the curvatures of space-time and property spaces? Wilczek is getting increasingly animated about the idea, slipping into hyperbole to see if anyone is still awake: \u201cEinstein struggled with this challenge for a full ten years, calling it \u2018years of anxious searching in the dark\u2019. He achieved enlightenment by discovering suitable equations for the curvature of space-time, which completed his new theory of gravity, general relativity. He discovered them by demanding that they embody what he called general covariance , which is the space-time version of local symmetry.\u201d With Galilean Translations, whether moving or still, the relative distances do not change, and so the forces remain constant. But if these relative distances change, what happens to the forces? Enter the idea of local symmetries; transformations that vary in both space and time. These are achieved by choosing transformations which only apply to parts of the whole Universe, and require a kind of intellectual yoga: \u201cThis is the yoga of local symmetry \u2013 if we have a metric fluid, and we make appropriate adjustments in the metric fluid at the same time we make the motions , then we can keep the relative distances, and force laws, intact! [\u2026] In this way, we recognise that many different images can represent the same object. But we can get more complex images, still using the same underlying object, if we allow for the presence of a distorting media \u2013 curved mirrors, says, or lenses and prisms . . . or, in general, structure that varies from place to place, and bends light. By allowing for the presence of media, we come to regard a much wider range of images as representing the same object. \u201d (emphasis original) I know the language is technical, but just sit with me for a while in this old hall, all wood-panelled and well-portraited, and consider the immensity of that idea. Marshall McLuhan may have thought the medium was the message, but he never got anywhere close to the actual maths. Why Electrons Actually Are Metaphors There\u2019s yet more to this rabbit hole, because quantum symmetries are not just about electrons, but also the \u201czoo\u201d of subatomic particles which make up all our eternal atoms. Unsurprisingly, the trinity of quarks which constitute part of the more popular protons, neutrons and electrons, can exist in many different states of motion, analogous to Bohr\u2019s \u201cstationary states\u201d and \u201chigh musicality\u201d. Over to Frank again: \u201cThese discretely different states have different energies and, therefore, different masses and so appear, operationally, as different particles! In this way, we find that many different particles reflect the same underlying material structure captured in different states of internal motion.\u201d An electron is a proton; its internal structure is just moving in a slightly different way at the time we measure it. It is the same object seen differently through the medium of electromagnetic fluid. This shows why electrons are metaphors for a level of reality we can\u2019t directly perceive. Electrons are not like other subatomic particles: they are other subatomic particles, just in different arrangements of motion, charge, and colour when consciously measured. Everything is dancing, within and without. Our external movement determines what our internal concept of \u201clife\u201d comes to mean; the internal movement of reality determines how it appears externally at a given moment of lived observation. Each dance is inextricably entwined with the other, born of the same beat, the same benevolence before which Newton and Maxwell and Hertz and so many others bowed. Three Wise Souls In order to understand something like strong property space and the way it curves (so important in beautiful dances), we need to assign it some coordinate system. This is called charge in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), but we require another property space called colour (for no good reason) to describe the full effect of the strong force. And, unlike photons which respond to electrical charge, but are neutral themselves, colour gluons interact with one another . Which is basically a bitch to work out, but leads to proof of the strong force via the grandiose-sounding asymptotic freedom of quarks \u2013 i.e. they\u2019re super-sticky at short distances, but the force fades away over larger distances due to the way gluons interact. Don\u2019t just glide over this, because asymptotic freedom implies a certain simplicity of behaviour at high energies, which brings with it a shower of gifts. The early Universe is comprehensible to us because it was such a high energy kind of party; we can read the message of high-energy collisions in labs today; and different forces come to seem less different at such energies. If that doesn\u2019t get you interested, just imagine asymptotic freedom as the physical equivalent of the Buddhist concept of the \u201cfreedom of no escape\u201d and wander on with this meditation. Describing the coming together of this theory as what is now known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), an animated Wilczek also invokes the spiritual: \u201cWhen David Gross and I, and independently David Politzer, discovered that it _is_possible, it was the sort of moment the Kabbala describes as the \u201ctrembling of the Veil of the Temple,\u201d when the shroud that keeps the divine world hidden from our vision stirs.\u201d Moreover, no longer is this the stirring dance of magic or mysticism, but one somehow even more filled with wonder; with the awe of patterned understanding. We move past Galileo, Maxwell and Einstein, to find ourselves before Emmy Noether and the maths of time translation symmetry so that we can see how the same laws of physics that apply today applied in the past and will continue on into the future. Noether, and the many other unsung women of science, bring us all the way back to Ecclesiastes in one, smooth movement: What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done and there is nothing new under the sun. Summing Up Wilczek, taking one last sip of water from a cup that still somehow seems mostly full, clears his throat for the final take. The central point of this whole evening has been, returning to the Saint Thomas quote which started it all off: Caravaggio\u2019s Incredulity of Saint Thomas \u201cOne sees, first, that Jesus does not resist Thomas\u2019s inquisitive examination, but rather welcomes it. And one sees that Thomas is fascinated and excited to discover that reality conforms to his deepest hopes. Doubting Thomas is a hero, a happy man [\u2026] Those whose faith is not passive, but engages reality, will receive a second, more fulfilling blessing in the harmony of belief and experience. Blessed are those who believe what they see.\u201d So, take a look at the coat of arms designed by Niels Bohr, and I\u2019ll leave you with the last six complementarities Wilczek bestowed upon us that night, in the hope it might lead a few weary souls somewhere closer to wisdom: Reduction and Abundance : The basic building blocks are few and profoundly simple, defined by high symmetries. The world of objects is infinitely various and complex. Object and Person : I am, and you are, a collection of subatomic particles. I am, and you are, a thinking person. Determined and Free : I am, and you are, a material object, subject to the laws of physics. I am, and you are, capable of making choices, for which we are responsible. Transient and Eternal : Everything is subject to change, or flux. Concepts live outside of time and, because All Things Are Number, can liberate us from it. Beautiful and Not Beautiful : The physical world embodies beauty. The physical world is home to suffering One World, and Many : The existence of surrounding immensities does not subtract from me, you, or humanity as a whole. It can and does expand our imagination. Niels Bohr\u2019s coat-of-arms. \u201cDo I contradict myself? \\ Very well, then, I contradict myself. \\ I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d - Whitman One story, one road now \\ is left: that it is. And on this there are signs \\ in plenty that, being, it is ungenerated and indestructible, \\ whole, of one kind and unwavering, and complete.

It was on science and perspective and beauty. His name is Frank Wilczek. He spoke slowly, with long pauses between thoughts as if trying to fit his hard-won truth into less than two hours was a task the difficulty of which few mortals could conceive, let alone complete. And yet, a grand picture emerged between all the slow sentences, as if the ineffable could be spoken of, could be sidled up to using pure symbol and just one question, sculpted from the lumps of rough stone we find strewn along our way through this one wild and precious life. Does nature embody beautiful ideas? Like all great queries, it is its simplicity that acts as a key capable of unlocking doors you didn\u2019t know were there.

The Greeks, however, were not able to answer the inevitable follow-up to Pythagoras\u2019 discoveries, namely; why do musical notes in ratios of small whole numbers sound beautiful to us humans? Well, by mapping the inner ear and casting our brain as a pattern prediction engine which experiences accurate forecasts as aesthetically pleasing, we can understand better our perception of sound. We can slip into the spaces between and hear that what we experience as beautiful are simply sounds which are predictable, i.e. those whose frequencies are in ratios of small whole numbers.","title":"Numbering the Harmonies"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#spiritual-science","text":"Of course \u2013 for the ancient Greeks \u2013 science and spirituality were not separate fields of study. E. O. Wilson calls this the \"Ionian Dream\" in his wonderful book \"Consilience\" - which is alaos well worth reading. In truth, every one of the greatest scientific minds since Pythagoras has entertained this same unificatory dream in some manner, and all of them - without fail - have pointed to some greater pattern behind what their work itself reveals. Newton is perhaps the best example: he was a deeply devout man, and yet his devotion was not the result of magical thinking: it was a consequence of the method of Analysis and Synthesis that he put forward most eloquently in Principia . It\u2019s worth repeating for emphasis: his devotion was not the result of his spirituality and, like, what he wanted to manifest; it was a consequence of his scientific view of the world. Through some of the most visionary, critical, and rational thinking ever conducted, Newton was brought to deeper insights about the nature of both himself, and the world of which he was a part. \u201cI do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\u201d \u201cFor so far as we can know by natural Philosophy what is the first Cause; what Power he has over us, and what benefits we receive from him, so far our Duty toward him, as well as that toward one another, will appear to us by the Light of Nature. And no doubt, if the Worship of false Gods had not blinded the Heathen, their moral Philosophy would have gone farther than to the four Cardinal Virtues; and instead of teaching the Transmigration of Souls, and to worship the Sun and Moon, and dead Heroes, they would have taught us to worship our true Author and Benefactor, as their Ancestors did under the Government of Noah and his Sons before they corrupted themselves.\u201d Newton was not, as so many pop-science writers would have you believe in a lazy turn of phrase, \u201cbrought to the edge of rationality\u201d and therefore forced into a faith-based leap into the unknown. He was shown that there is no end to rational thought; no possibility of ever actually reaching the boundary between this and oneness. It is a vital distinction: his is a faith built on the wonder of endless permutations of what is, not a faith built on some supposed bound to rational enquiry and its demand that we believe in the inexplicable. The same goes for Plato, Euclid, Galileo, Copernicus, Leibniz, Kepler, Maxwell, Faraday, Einstein, Bohr, Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Noether, Jeans, Sagan, Feynman, Levin and countless other scientists who are, at heart, some of the deepest and most sincere \u201cbelievers\u201d in history.","title":"Spiritual Science"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#the-work-will-teach-you-how-to-do-it","text":"Kepler in his younger days, imagining the revolution of planets to be ruled by the spacing between five platonic solids, once wrote: \u201cGod himself was too kind to remain idle, and began to play the game of signatures, signing his likeness into the world; therefore I chance to think that all nature and the graceful sky are symbolized in the art of geometry.\u201d Of course, the work taught him that his model was wrong; the planets revolve along more complicated ellipses. However, for staying true to observation, Lady Science granted him three laws of planetary motion on top of which Newton would later stand, held still to the ground by the kindness of gravity. Kepler knew that God was still playing the game of signatures; it was just that the tune was signed far deeper than he had ever dreamed (though that did not make his sky any less graceful, his art any less geometric). Most interestingly, the Ideal world of Platonic solids played a big role in the development of Kepler\u2019s very Real laws. This would have no doubt pleased Plato, because the primary search for beauty was pretty much his ding an sig . He argued that there was a realm of Ideas (or Ideals), which was eternal and unchanging and provided the source of all we can name. Though limiting, it is also the source of our liberation. In a dialogue between Socrates and Glaucon in the Republic where they talk about The Cave, he has Socrates describe liberation as an active process of learning and engagement so as to live in awareness of the Ideal behind the Real. Science, looked at through this historical lense, can best be described as the incremental (con)fusion \u2013 based on observation \u2013 of the Real with the Ideal. Wilczek sums it up well: \u201cAlong the inward path, we examine our concepts critically, and try to strip them of the dross of mere appearance, to reach their ideal (i.e. Ideal) meaning. This is the path of philosophy and metaphysics. Along the outward path, we engage appearances critically, and try to strip them of complications, to find their hidden essence.

Criticism which engages appearance is called deconstructive , because it attempts to reduce down the whole event, via analysis and synthesis, so as to find its \u201chidden essence\u201d. Paradoxically, it\u2019s the deconstructionists who can impact the real world reliably. Observing appearances, trying to measure what causes them, and reasoning about the general laws which govern such behaviour leads as surely to technological development as it did to Kepler\u2019s or Newton\u2019s reductionist wonder. On that note, \u201creductionist\u201d has unfortunately become a dirty word, which seems unfair. Reducing complexity into simpler parts is an incredibly powerful way to think which made its appearance long after myth or narrative in the evolutionary development of human mind. We should not be so quick to discard it. After discussing the art of perspective drawing, its links to geometry, the discovery of vanishing points on the horizon, and the way such concepts enrich our experience of the Real, as well as our ability to describe it, Wilczek said: \u201cWhen I am alert to these things, my experience is fuller and more vivid. I hope you will find this happens for you too. Through disciplined imagination we transcend the Cave of ignorant sensation.\u201d Stumbling further out the cave with the hard-won ability to render, and therefore think critically about, different perspectives led inexorably to two very important questions: what does the same picture look like seen from other angles; and what remains the same no matter which perspective you adopt?","title":"Critically Acclaimed"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#imagining-real-symmetries","text":"Both questions have fundamentally to do with symmetry , what Wilczek described that cold night in Oxford as \u201cChange Without Change.\u201d We know, for instance, that the laws of motion do not change whether you are standing still, or moving at a constant speed. This is called Galilean Translation Symmetry and lies at the heart of Einstein\u2019s Special Relativity. Of course, Einstein was not the first to make use of symmetries to discipline his imagination so that it might produce something which accurately describes the Real. Maxwell\u2019s equations for light display some of the most profound symmetry anywhere in mathematics, and the pattern they uncover has become the basis for describing both the strong and weak nuclear forces, too. The really beautiful thing about Change Without Change when we can capture it mathematically was perhaps summed up best by Heinrich Hertz (in a tribute to Maxwell): \u201cOne cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.\u201d You see, Maxwell\u2019s equations describe far more than just visible light. I\u2019m not sure how often you think of it this way, but they reveal how, to Wilczek\u2019s mind, \u201cRadio waves are just \u2018light\u2019 with a much longer wavelength, and lower frequency, than visible light. In other words, in radio waves the oscillations between electric and magnetic fields take place more gradually in space, and more slowly in time . Going from radio toward shorter wavelengths, we meet microwaves, infrared, the visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.

They\u2019re all in Maxwell\u2019s equations.\u201d Maxwell showed the almost omnipotent power of thinking not just in terms of perspective , but also in terms of a conscious search for symmetry . Plato, again, would have been proud. In fact, Wilczek \u2013 at a half-whisper \u2013 continued, \u201cwe have learned to work from symmetry toward truth.

Basically, the core idea in the quantum world is that everything can be described by its wave function. This sounds cool, but there are three major points to be aware of: Working with wave functions yields probabilities, not definite answers. You don\u2019t get access to the wave function itself, only a peek at processed versions of it. Answering different questions may require processing the wave function in different, and mutually exclusive, ways. These, in turn, raise conceptual issues. The first raises the issue of determinism : is calculating probabilities really the best we can do? The second raises the issue of many worlds : what does the full wave function describe when we\u2019re not peeking; a gigantic expansion of reality, or is it just a mind tool, no more real than a dream? The third raises the issue of complementarity : which turns out to be both a feature of physical reality and a lesson in wisdom. The complementarity principle holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously, and was first described by Niels Bohr. Bohr had also done a bunch of work on the \u201cstationary states\u201d of atoms based on their absorption and emission spectra (back to light and connectivity), summing it up neatly with the idea that there was something of the \u201chighest musicality\u201d in how it all fit together. This is more than a nice way of speaking, because it turns out that the Schrodinger wave equation for an electron in an atom looks very similar to the equation for vibrations in a musical instrument first mentioned in relation to Pythagoras, the length and tension of strings, and the notion that All Things Are Number . Natural vibrations in musical instruments produce pleasing sounds; natural vibrations in an electron\u2019s wave function also turn out to mean something simple and appealing for its probability cloud \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change at all. Such solutions have the properties Bohr anticipated in his \u201cstationary states\u201d: the electron will persist in any of these patterns indefinitely, and no other patterns have that property. \u201cStatic states\u201d of a single-electron system, i.e. Hydrogen Harmonic patterns formed using different frequencies on a soundboard. They share deep similarities because the equations governing them have the same pattern or shape. Of course, as with everything in the quantum world, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. Not only do the building blocks of our universe consist of probabilities with a tendency to travel in ways which match the harmonies of musical instruments; those building blocks exist in vast numbers of identical copies, which neither evolve nor erode, nor, in a stable environment, display any properties that change in time. Looking back in history, thanks to the finite speed of light, we may see, through their spectra, that the atoms in galaxies a long time ago, and far far away, behave in the same way as the atoms we see on Earth today. If atoms are so stable and resistant to change, how did they arise in the first place?

Wilczek is getting increasingly animated about the idea, slipping into hyperbole to see if anyone is still awake: \u201cEinstein struggled with this challenge for a full ten years, calling it \u2018years of anxious searching in the dark\u2019. He achieved enlightenment by discovering suitable equations for the curvature of space-time, which completed his new theory of gravity, general relativity. He discovered them by demanding that they embody what he called general covariance , which is the space-time version of local symmetry.\u201d With Galilean Translations, whether moving or still, the relative distances do not change, and so the forces remain constant. But if these relative distances change, what happens to the forces? Enter the idea of local symmetries; transformations that vary in both space and time. These are achieved by choosing transformations which only apply to parts of the whole Universe, and require a kind of intellectual yoga: \u201cThis is the yoga of local symmetry \u2013 if we have a metric fluid, and we make appropriate adjustments in the metric fluid at the same time we make the motions , then we can keep the relative distances, and force laws, intact! [\u2026] In this way, we recognise that many different images can represent the same object. But we can get more complex images, still using the same underlying object, if we allow for the presence of a distorting media \u2013 curved mirrors, says, or lenses and prisms . . . or, in general, structure that varies from place to place, and bends light. By allowing for the presence of media, we come to regard a much wider range of images as representing the same object. \u201d (emphasis original) I know the language is technical, but just sit with me for a while in this old hall, all wood-panelled and well-portraited, and consider the immensity of that idea. Marshall McLuhan may have thought the medium was the message, but he never got anywhere close to the actual maths.","title":"Covariance and Collisions"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#why-electrons-actually-are-metaphors","text":"There\u2019s yet more to this rabbit hole, because quantum symmetries are not just about electrons, but also the \u201czoo\u201d of subatomic particles which make up all our eternal atoms. Unsurprisingly, the trinity of quarks which constitute part of the more popular protons, neutrons and electrons, can exist in many different states of motion, analogous to Bohr\u2019s \u201cstationary states\u201d and \u201chigh musicality\u201d. Over to Frank again: \u201cThese discretely different states have different energies and, therefore, different masses and so appear, operationally, as different particles! In this way, we find that many different particles reflect the same underlying material structure captured in different states of internal motion.\u201d An electron is a proton; its internal structure is just moving in a slightly different way at the time we measure it. It is the same object seen differently through the medium of electromagnetic fluid. This shows why electrons are metaphors for a level of reality we can\u2019t directly perceive. Electrons are not like other subatomic particles: they are other subatomic particles, just in different arrangements of motion, charge, and colour when consciously measured. Everything is dancing, within and without. Our external movement determines what our internal concept of \u201clife\u201d comes to mean; the internal movement of reality determines how it appears externally at a given moment of lived observation. Each dance is inextricably entwined with the other, born of the same beat, the same benevolence before which Newton and Maxwell and Hertz and so many others bowed.","title":"Why Electrons Actually Are Metaphors"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#three-wise-souls","text":"In order to understand something like strong property space and the way it curves (so important in beautiful dances), we need to assign it some coordinate system. This is called charge in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), but we require another property space called colour (for no good reason) to describe the full effect of the strong force. And, unlike photons which respond to electrical charge, but are neutral themselves, colour gluons interact with one another . Which is basically a bitch to work out, but leads to proof of the strong force via the grandiose-sounding asymptotic freedom of quarks \u2013 i.e. they\u2019re super-sticky at short distances, but the force fades away over larger distances due to the way gluons interact. Don\u2019t just glide over this, because asymptotic freedom implies a certain simplicity of behaviour at high energies, which brings with it a shower of gifts. The early Universe is comprehensible to us because it was such a high energy kind of party; we can read the message of high-energy collisions in labs today; and different forces come to seem less different at such energies. If that doesn\u2019t get you interested, just imagine asymptotic freedom as the physical equivalent of the Buddhist concept of the \u201cfreedom of no escape\u201d and wander on with this meditation. Describing the coming together of this theory as what is now known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), an animated Wilczek also invokes the spiritual: \u201cWhen David Gross and I, and independently David Politzer, discovered that it _is_possible, it was the sort of moment the Kabbala describes as the \u201ctrembling of the Veil of the Temple,\u201d when the shroud that keeps the divine world hidden from our vision stirs.\u201d Moreover, no longer is this the stirring dance of magic or mysticism, but one somehow even more filled with wonder; with the awe of patterned understanding. We move past Galileo, Maxwell and Einstein, to find ourselves before Emmy Noether and the maths of time translation symmetry so that we can see how the same laws of physics that apply today applied in the past and will continue on into the future. Noether, and the many other unsung women of science, bring us all the way back to Ecclesiastes in one, smooth movement: What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done and there is nothing new under the sun.","title":"Three Wise Souls"},{"location":"essays/a-beautiful-question/#summing-up","text":"Wilczek, taking one last sip of water from a cup that still somehow seems mostly full, clears his throat for the final take. The central point of this whole evening has been, returning to the Saint Thomas quote which started it all off: Caravaggio\u2019s Incredulity of Saint Thomas \u201cOne sees, first, that Jesus does not resist Thomas\u2019s inquisitive examination, but rather welcomes it. And one sees that Thomas is fascinated and excited to discover that reality conforms to his deepest hopes. Doubting Thomas is a hero, a happy man [\u2026] Those whose faith is not passive, but engages reality, will receive a second, more fulfilling blessing in the harmony of belief and experience. Blessed are those who believe what they see.\u201d So, take a look at the coat of arms designed by Niels Bohr, and I\u2019ll leave you with the last six complementarities Wilczek bestowed upon us that night, in the hope it might lead a few weary souls somewhere closer to wisdom: Reduction and Abundance : The basic building blocks are few and profoundly simple, defined by high symmetries. The world of objects is infinitely various and complex. Object and Person : I am, and you are, a collection of subatomic particles. I am, and you are, a thinking person. Determined and Free : I am, and you are, a material object, subject to the laws of physics. I am, and you are, capable of making choices, for which we are responsible. Transient and Eternal : Everything is subject to change, or flux. Concepts live outside of time and, because All Things Are Number, can liberate us from it. Beautiful and Not Beautiful : The physical world embodies beauty. The physical world is home to suffering One World, and Many : The existence of surrounding immensities does not subtract from me, you, or humanity as a whole. It can and does expand our imagination. Niels Bohr\u2019s coat-of-arms. \u201cDo I contradict myself? \\ Very well, then, I contradict myself. \\ I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d - Whitman One story, one road now \\ is left: that it is. And on this there are signs \\ in plenty that, being, it is ungenerated and indestructible, \\ whole, of one kind and unwavering, and complete.

Inspiration and the sort of motivation it takes to act in both courteous and selfless ways can only\u200a\u2014\u200aand must always\u200a\u2014\u200acome from within. That said, I admit to having one true hero: a man by the name of Bantu Steve Biko. If you haven\u2019t read the collection of this singular human\u2019s thoughts I Write What I Like , I recommend stopping here and familiarising yourself with his own words, rather than my interpretation. Biko lived in a different time\u200a\u2014\u200aa time when the enemy was well-known and relatively homogeneous. He was surrounded by a community united in a common fight for universal rights and suffrage. Materially and physically, the struggle he found himself in and which he came to lead with such humility and grace, was decidedly more taxing than that facing our generation. Intellectually, though, the lines were far more clear cut. The enemy is no longer homogeneous\u200a\u2014\u200ait does not have one colour or one set of laws which can easily be pointed to and vilified. It does not have men like Verwoed and Botha to epitomise what must be fought against, and it does not have stand-out leaders like Mandela, Sobukwe and Biko to unite a large community in the pursuit of a common aim. Ours is an inescapably grey world . This does not mean that this generation does not have anything to fight for, or that it lacks the stomach to stand up for the sort of values which have always been worth protecting: responsibility, trust, faith, and love. All it means is that the battle is now exponentially more complex. However, one need not understand fully the global set of problems we now face in order to act meaningfully. This is where Biko\u2019s philosophy comes into its own, for it was\u200a\u2014\u200afirst and foremost\u200a\u2014\u200aa positive set of ideas based on conscious knowledge of the worth of one\u2019s self as a human being. Though our world is a complex and grey one, and though the fight for a more equitable and just life for all seems interminable and unwinnable, it is from philosophies and politics like Biko\u2019s that we can draw both inspiration and clues to what solutions for our times might look like. There is, after all, nothing new under the sun. Why Western Liberalism Sucks In an essay entitled Black Souls in White Skins? , Biko turned his forceful and direct rhetoric on the figure of the white liberal: \u201cThat curious bunch of nonconformists who explain their participation in negative terms: that bunch of do-gooders that goes under all sorts of names\u200a\u2014\u200aliberals, leftists, etc [\u2026] Nowhere is the arrogance of the liberal ideology demonstrated so well as in their insistence that the problems of the country can only be solved by a bilateral approach involving both black and white [\u2026] The integration they talk about is artificial in that is a response to a conscious manoeuvre [by the apartheid government] rather than to the dictates of the inner soul.\u201d I think this is an important point to note, for there are an increasing number of people who describe the problems of our modern world in precisely such negative and supposedly non-conformist ways, mistaking themselves as having unique and valuable insights. In a later essay, Biko laid the blame for such arrogance and hypocrisy squarely at the feet of Western culture, in which: \u201cA visitor to someone\u2019s house is always met with the question \u2018What can I do for you?\u2019. This attitude to see people not as themselves but as agents for some particular function is foreign [to Africans]. We are not a suspicious race. We believe in the inherent goodness of man. We enjoy man for himself. We regard our living together not as an unfortunate mishap warranting endless competition among us but as a deliberate act of God to make us a community of brothers and sisters jointly involved in the quest for composite answers to the varied problems of life.\u201d Having identified the perpetrators of the more subtle and insidious kinds of evil that average men and women are prone to give themselves over to, Biko presents what he believed to be a uniquely Black, African solution: \u201cIn rejecting Western values, therefore, we are rejecting those things that are not only foreign to us but that seek to destroy the most cherished of our beliefs\u200a\u2014\u200athat the cornerstone of society is man himself\u200a\u2014\u200anot just his welfare, not his material well-being but just man himself with all his ramifications. We reject the power-based society of the Westerner that seems to be ever concerned with perfecting their technological know-how while losing out on their spiritual dimension. We believe that in the long run the special contribution to the world by Africa will be in this field of human relationship. The great powers of the world may have done wonders in giving the world a military and industrial look, but the great gift still has to come from Africa\u200a\u2014\u200agiving the world a more human face.\u201d Use Your Heart, Free Your Mind For thinking and speaking like this, Bantu Steve Biko wins my undying love. His words have a physical effect on me, starting as goosebumps in my milky-white skin, surging through my stomach, and stopping in my lungs, where breath can no longer pass, so caught is it in the implications of his words. It was Biko's realisation\u200a\u2014\u200adrawn from a long history of African thought collected under the umbrella term of \u2018ubuntu\u2019 \u200a\u2014\u200athat community was the place from which one drew both true power and comprehension which singled him out as such a brilliant and persuasive individual. It was his realisation that there is nothing more worthwhile or noble than fighting to give society a more human face, and that such a \u2018fight\u2019 will always, in fact, take on the nature of a gift given by what he termed \u2018selfless revolutionaries\u2019 that marks him forever as my only true hero. It was, indeed, Biko who first argued that: \u201cAt the heart of such [communal, human-centric] thinking is the realisation by blacks that the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.\u201d This is true in any generation\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how complex the world they face. And it remains as necessary today to free your mind from both the narrow, capitalistic narrative that what you make and who you know are all that matters; as well as the equally simplistic and misleading narratives of transcendence, abundance, thriving, or whatever other buzzword you care to pick as you scroll down the omnipresent newsfeed. We live in dangerously interesting times. There are no simple choices left, but this should not prevent an honest reckoning with what Biko called \u2018the dictates of the inner soul\u2019 for it is there\u200a\u2014\u200aas it always has been\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are most likely to stumble upon truth. Finally, in a letter to a priest, Biko summed up his thoughts by writing, clearly and elegantly: \u201cIn my view the truth lies in my ability to incorporate my vertical relationship with God into my horizontal relationships with my fellow men; in my ability to pursue my ultimate purpose on earth which is to do good.\u201d If only a few more humans in our age were gifted with such simple genius. Singular Love Ultimately, I don\u2019t think that living in a grey world is a terrible burden. The complexity we face is far greater than it has ever been, but this also means that the opportunities we are presented with are more varied and accessible. As for the almost-interminably interwoven and complex nature of power that we face\u200a\u2014\u200aand to which we must always endeavour to speak our truth\u200a\u2014\u200aI can only paraphrase the two most formative movies of my life: on romantic evenings of self I go salsa dancing with my own confusion, for a revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having. Finally, Biko - with Mandela - is the man most representative of the political singularity that took place in South Africa at the end of the 20 th Century. In this context, I use \u201csingularity\u201d to point at a being or action so extraordinary in its scope or vision that they echo throughout history and change indelibly the nature of the lives or actions that follow. Simply put, Biko is proof that singularities happen, and have always happened, lodged as they are in the breasts of human beings who act with the righteous might of selfless revolutionaries. Bantu Steve Biko\u2019s life is proof that there exists in this world a kind of love that does not make any proclamations of its worth, nor ask anything of its beloved. A kind of love that is fragile and vulnerable enough to die in the back of a police van somewhere between Port Elizabeth and Pretoria. A kind of love strong enough to resurrect itself in the hearts and minds of people for generations unending. A kind of love that is at once unique, finite, and deeply personal, and simultaneously universal. A kind of love that is eternal. His life is proof of the ordinary nature of miracles and what I once heard called \u201cthe tender gravity of kindness\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa cosmic force powered by the simple conviction of true belief.","title":"Martyr of Hope"},{"location":"essays/bantu-steve-biko/#martyr-of-hope-a-tribute-to-bantu-steve-biko","text":"","title":"Martyr of Hope - A Tribute to Bantu Steve Biko"},{"location":"essays/bantu-steve-biko/#conscious-struggle","text":"I have never been a fan of heroes.

And that is poetry.\u201d \u2014 Muriel Rukeyser The Blue Book is alive! There Is No Time Like The Present My first book was a slim, physical thing , with intersecting railway lines on the cover, printed by some friends in East London. It was fun to publish \u2013 I got to learn about the industry, see some industrial printers at work, and generally be a part of inscribing immaterial thoughts onto the material world. To publish a book is to join a long and storied tradition of pattern-making people who try to pull from their imagination real possibilities for other ways of being. It is to become, literally, the diviner of signs as seen through the lens of ordinary life. This is not really anything Big or Mysterious and Mystical. It is not even Spiritual. It is simply the honest and sincere remembrance of what it\u2019s like to live: \u201cTime seemed to vanish. Urgency vanished. Any important difference between myself and all other things vanished. I knew that I belonged to the world, and felt comfortably my own containment in the totality. I did not feel that I understood any mystery, not at all; rather that I could be happy and feel blessed within the perplexity \u2014 the summer morning, its gentleness, the sense of the great work being done though the grass where I stood scarcely trembled. As I say, it was the most casual of moments, not mystical as the word is usually meant, for there was no vision, or anything extraordinary at all, but only a sudden awareness of the citizenry of all things within one world: leaves, dust, thrushes and finches, men and women. And yet it was a moment I have never forgotten, and upon which I have based many decisions in the years since\u201d \u2014 Mary Oliver I\u2019ve spent the last few years loafing in the greener fields of the internet, wondering about alternative forms for books, inspired by two, very different thoughts which mingle in strange ways. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote about the difference between applicability and allegory , claiming the first to be infinitely better. Applicability opens the door to interpretation by the reader, whereas allegory lies in the \u201cpurposed domination of the author\u201d. Basically, if you\u2019re arrogant enough to think you can come up with an allegory that adequately expresses the age you live in, you\u2019re better off writing pulp fiction. If a book is written and read not allegorically, but with a view to how it applies to your life , then a wonderful translation has occurred and it may open the door onto what Tolkien called \u201cOther Time\u201d. In \u201cG\u04e7del, Escher, Bach\u201d, Douglas Hofstadter makes the point that: \u201cBefore Avery had established the connection between genes and DNA, the physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger predicted, on purely theoretical grounds, that genetic information would have to be stored in \u2018aperiodic crystals\u2019, in his influential book What Is Life? In fact, books themselves are aperiodic crystals contained inside neat geometrical forms.\u201d GEB is way too dense to summarise here, but this is a crucial point. Books encode, literally, some pattern of mind (or soul, or personality depending on your interests) which is timeless, and can be passed from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cI\u201d potentially forever. This pattern is stored, like DNA and many other dense and self-recursive encodings of meaning, in physical form: strings of letters printed sequentially and bound between a cover. However, online media offer other ways to encode the same, timeless, pattern; ways which are potentially more expansive. Ways which will take you directly to other authors, other times, other songs which sing what this one cannot. Applied Writing Following Tolkien, digital books need to be applicable to the context_they\u2019re in: which is hypertextual and constantly connected. In fact, it is \u2013 if anything \u2013 overly connected. If the art of good storytelling has to do with what you leave out, then how can anyone possibly tell a story about what the _internet really is and what new zones of consciousness it might allow us to explore collaboratively? There is simply too much you have to ignore. Certainly this is true in the context of a traditional book, but what happens if we take the lessons of Hofstadter and Tolkien, and try and come up with a form which allows for more expansive story-telling ? If there were a book that was also an open-source piece of software , that anyone could download and adapt free of charge, then not only would that book exist hypertextually, linking to what it cannot say, but anyone could replicate its form (easily and for free) to tell their own story about everything to which they\u2019re connected. If all the data stored in such repositories were to remain open source, then we could potentially train our models, our machines, and our minds in more effective ways so that we can continuously improve the worlds we inhabit and the words we use to describe them. Structure and Song I couldn\u2019t find something that exactly fit this description though. There are plenty of digital book frameworks out there, but none that think clearly enough about the form I feel is necessary for such a project. My struggle with this is described in Fugue II . Eventually, I just adapted a piece of software I helped write for the Status documentation site, for the simple reason that it is responsive on mobile screens, and allows me to nest content in the sidebar, so that anyone can navigate around the book easily, no matter which device or perspective they look at it through. Building an online book gives you an extra degree of freedom in terms of how you structure content, as there are \u2013 by virtue of the medium itself \u2013 many different ways to move around the text. The Blue Book is structured as one, long song with three major parts and two , accompanying (explanatory) fugues . Or is it many intersecting melodies which are sometimes harmonious, sometimes discordant, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and sometimes just plain weird? You can begin and end wherever you please, whether that\u2019s in a specific poem, with one of the video frontispieces for each Canto, deep in the tangled bank I continue to build, or just scrolling through the YouTube playlist which forms the literal sound-trace of the book. For extra context; \u201cCanto\u201d is the Italian word for \u201cverse\u201d and a Fugue is a \u201ca contrapuntal composition in which a short melody or phrase (the subject) is introduced by one part and successively taken up by others and developed by interweaving the parts.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s a complicated piece of music that winds back on itself in all these strange ways that tend to bend your emotions and expectations in both tragic and beautiful ways. If you\u2019re wondering about the choice of name, keep in mind that blue is the colour of devotion, and watch this video to understand the intellectual lineage I place myself in. Bitcoin Another surprising influence in my work is Bitcoin. Very simply put, through using Proof of Work, Bitcoin is able to translate physical stuff (electricity) into digital value without the need for a government or bank to stand surety for that value. Which means we can build networks between peers that allow for free speech in a much more profound sense than previously possible. This all relies on being able to prove online that you did physical work, which is much harder than it sounds and was a real breakthrough when it happened in 2009. However, if the past ten years have proved anything, it\u2019s that just giving people the ability to speak and transact more freely does not mean that they understand how to use this new ability (money is speech, hence \u201cput your money where your mouth is\u201d etc.). Sometimes, in this weird future we\u2019re living in, we don\u2019t need better technology: we need better people. Bitcoin showed us the beginning of what is really possible online, the real question has now become; if you could prove anything using the internet and its vast resources of knowledge, what would it be? I chose love, because that is what most interests me. I\u2019m not actually saying that it is possible to do anything as absurd as \u201cprove\u201d love, but I do think it might be beautiful to try nonetheless. And I do think that such a project might be helpful one day when we\u2019re trying to teach machines how to love, which is likely going to be quite important to our continued survival. Love I once drew a geometrical diagram for an English Masters thesis , and people looked at me like I was completely crazy. So, I won\u2019t provide a mathematical view of The Blue Book, nor will I claim that it has any of the properties relevant to a \u201creal\u201d proof. What I will say is that this is my most honest and sincere expression of love as I have found and experienced it in my short time here. It is love as it has applied to me. In my eyes, it proves love as an independent and powerful force. But only in my eyes: I do not think it is a general proof. That you must write yourself. Hopefully, in expressing sincerely our own particular truths, we can \u2013 by some strangely applied grace \u2013 touch on the universal beneath and above our individual love: for in such moments can be found the ultimate service of life.","title":"Blue Devotion"},{"location":"essays/blue-devotion/#blue-devotion","text":"\u201cBut there is one kind of knowledge \u2014 infinitely precious, time-resistant more than monuments, here to be passed between the generations in any way it may be: never to be used.

It was fun to publish \u2013 I got to learn about the industry, see some industrial printers at work, and generally be a part of inscribing immaterial thoughts onto the material world. To publish a book is to join a long and storied tradition of pattern-making people who try to pull from their imagination real possibilities for other ways of being. It is to become, literally, the diviner of signs as seen through the lens of ordinary life. This is not really anything Big or Mysterious and Mystical. It is not even Spiritual. It is simply the honest and sincere remembrance of what it\u2019s like to live: \u201cTime seemed to vanish. Urgency vanished. Any important difference between myself and all other things vanished. I knew that I belonged to the world, and felt comfortably my own containment in the totality. I did not feel that I understood any mystery, not at all; rather that I could be happy and feel blessed within the perplexity \u2014 the summer morning, its gentleness, the sense of the great work being done though the grass where I stood scarcely trembled. As I say, it was the most casual of moments, not mystical as the word is usually meant, for there was no vision, or anything extraordinary at all, but only a sudden awareness of the citizenry of all things within one world: leaves, dust, thrushes and finches, men and women. And yet it was a moment I have never forgotten, and upon which I have based many decisions in the years since\u201d \u2014 Mary Oliver I\u2019ve spent the last few years loafing in the greener fields of the internet, wondering about alternative forms for books, inspired by two, very different thoughts which mingle in strange ways. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote about the difference between applicability and allegory , claiming the first to be infinitely better. Applicability opens the door to interpretation by the reader, whereas allegory lies in the \u201cpurposed domination of the author\u201d. Basically, if you\u2019re arrogant enough to think you can come up with an allegory that adequately expresses the age you live in, you\u2019re better off writing pulp fiction. If a book is written and read not allegorically, but with a view to how it applies to your life , then a wonderful translation has occurred and it may open the door onto what Tolkien called \u201cOther Time\u201d. In \u201cG\u04e7del, Escher, Bach\u201d, Douglas Hofstadter makes the point that: \u201cBefore Avery had established the connection between genes and DNA, the physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger predicted, on purely theoretical grounds, that genetic information would have to be stored in \u2018aperiodic crystals\u2019, in his influential book What Is Life? In fact, books themselves are aperiodic crystals contained inside neat geometrical forms.\u201d GEB is way too dense to summarise here, but this is a crucial point. Books encode, literally, some pattern of mind (or soul, or personality depending on your interests) which is timeless, and can be passed from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cI\u201d potentially forever. This pattern is stored, like DNA and many other dense and self-recursive encodings of meaning, in physical form: strings of letters printed sequentially and bound between a cover. However, online media offer other ways to encode the same, timeless, pattern; ways which are potentially more expansive. Ways which will take you directly to other authors, other times, other songs which sing what this one cannot.","title":"There Is No Time Like The Present"},{"location":"essays/blue-devotion/#applied-writing","text":"Following Tolkien, digital books need to be applicable to the context_they\u2019re in: which is hypertextual and constantly connected.

It only peaks above the horizon and casts a rippling road of yellow light over the sea an hour or two before midnight, which means the stars here on the Wild Coast are something to behold on clear evenings. The Milky Way runs across the whole sky like an old mineral line across this third rock, revealing a way to orient yourself that all our city lights have lost in the haste and hurry of modern life. Life is everywhere. It settles in every tense and all the spaces in the sentences we make up. Two nights ago, I took a new friend down to the beach after sunset and before N/aueema , our moon, made her late appearance. We went down to the sea to walk on sky. To wander between the stars cast perfectly in reverse on this first mirror, shining in the millimetre of silk left floating above the saturated sands as the tide retreats, as if all the waters in the world were needed somewhere else to raise the white knight, keep her circling our home, before they wash back in and herald another golden dawn. We wandered through the past, pointing out all the constellations we could remember, telling old stories about Orion and Sirius and Andromeda and all the stars between, so thick you can barely see any background. And then we sat on the shore, the sea itself our incense, and listened to an old Tibetan bowl sing of emptiness and submission and what it means to be saved by grace. In such a magical place, with myth so palpable you can feel it without reading any words, still this new friend struggled with meditation. Even here, covered in the African dark, it can be difficult to empty your mind. But \u201cthe point\u201d of meditation is not to get good at sitting around, thinking about nothing. If anything, it is to turn the living of life into a meditation: every act and thought achieved in a reflective and care-full way. Just as \u201cthe point\u201d of shamanism or sangomahood is not to learn how to hold ceremonies, but rather to turn living itself into a ceremony: every act and thought ceremonial, done with a sense of sacrifice and stepping aside to let what is sing its singular song. We might even say that \u201cthe point\u201d of art is not to produce a masterwork, but rather to turn your own life into such a masterwork through creative attention to the kind of details others miss. This is a yoga: to turn the living of life into one, continuous piece of art made up of discrete and jewell-like moments, separate in time and space, but connected by the kind of beauty that will save our world. Massaging the Medium One of the most powerful media we have for achieving such a lofty aim is simply conversation . If you can listen to others deeply enough to learn how they love, which is to say to learn how they see the world the way it is and somehow agree to go on living, you can enter into a sincere dialogue where all is performance and nothing is kept secret. By asking good questions, rather than just listening to respond, and by letting the \u201cthird space\u201d between us lead any collection of words we might utter or encounter closer to the truth as it is in that moment, we can colour our lives with all the strangest and most awesome shades. Knowing the depth and wealth of colour that awaits us in the shadows is yet another kind of yoga. Which leads me to two fantastic conversations I\u2019ve had recently \u2013 one with an engineer, the other with an artist \u2013 about colourful people. It seemed, in both talks, that humanity can be roughly divided into \u201ccolourful\u201d and \u201cgrey\u201d people. Colourful people are those you meet who seem always to have an interesting question or answer for you, who bleed light despite themselves and come to conversations armed with pebbles carved down from what were once mountains and leave them humbly at your doorstep for some time later when you\u2019re finally ready to notice them. Grey people are those you meet who seem always to have a problem, who respond only insofar as it relates to themselves and their own suffering. In the artist\u2019s rendering, they are the \u201cadults\u201d of this world, so crusted up with old and narrow ways of seeing that they must be broken down again before they can realise what it\u2019s really all about. Born and Made However, while I think full human being may well be an achievement we must work to reclaim after growing out of childhood, I have this sense that colour is a birthright. We find ourselves somewhere mysterious between the born and the made, and I cannot help but believe that everyone is at least born with the ability to be colourful, even if making ourselves into a human being who can respond appropriately always to our world and the others with whom we share it is something of which many fall short. Moreover, the point is not really to \u201cbreak others down\u201d so that they can see again what simply is. There is, firstly, a notion of hubris in this not suited to fine art. Who are you? Why is your way of seeing any better than any other? Secondly, looking at the world this way gets tiring quickly. If you think constantly that you are responsible for shattering the glass lens of others\u2019 illusions, that you must always be \u201cgood\u201d despite living in a world full of suffering, then it tends to get pretty overwhelming pretty fast. The cognitive dissonance is immense. Again, who are you to be good? Why should what is good to you also be good for others? You do not have to be good. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. \u2014 Mary Oliver These lenses through which we look at the world \u2013 the ones which become encrusted as we move away from childhood and make ourselves, with the help of a largely harsh and indifferent world, into adults \u2013 are an inevitability. Much like the self or the ego, any introspective journey will show them up as ultimately illusory and responsible for a whole bunch of distortion, but it will also eventually bring you back to realising just how important such wilful distortions of the world are for practical action: we cannot survive the immensity of the ordinary without a motivating ego. Converse With Care The goal of artistic conversation is not to shatter others\u2019 lenses, nor to show up your own as somehow clearer. If anything, it is to realise through paying attention that everybody is born colourful and sometimes all we need to do is stand next to another human and help them turn their inevitable lens just the slightest bit, so that instead of letting the light pass through grey and unnoticed, we might bend by a tiny amount and reveal the whole rainbow spectrum. Colour is our birthright. Turning that smallest bit to reflect it, perhaps the only thing worth achieving. This is, after all, where we get the word \u201cparable\u201d from: translated literally as \u201cto place beside\u201d. Though all art \u2013 including life \u2013 can only ever be a representation, by placing ourselves beside others and loving them for whatever they have learnt from their unique experience, we can turn our own being into a story which signifies something greater; something that cannot quite be got at through conventional language. Then, of course, comes the near-completion of the enso that brings us back to will and representation , and how these operate as an effective means of choosing the part(s) of the spectrum which most draw your eye; how they allow you to live in your colour and make it a part of the breath your draw each new day. Or you can try skipping across the whole rainbow gaily, lost in wonder that we could have forgotten \u2013 even for a moment \u2013 that there are places in this world where you can walk on stars and sing in tandem with sea and the otherwise perfect silence.","title":"All The Colourful People"},{"location":"essays/colourful-people/#all-the-colourful-people","text":"The half moon is rising late at the moment.

In order to explain, I had to go back to the year I graduated high school, which was \u2013 coincidentally \u2013 the year Bitcoin was unleashed onto the world. Maths and Metaphors I set out to study Maths and Physics because I wanted to understand the universe as completely as possible, and those two subjects seemed to offer the most precise, succinct and \u2013 frankly \u2013 beautiful symbolic language for doing so. However, G\u00f6del\u2019s incomplete shadow lurks in later years for unsuspecting maths students, and Heisenberg herds his cats with uncertainty through physics buildings late at night. I remember distinctly one lecturer, actually called Dr Haggard, with this crazy beard and the sort of kortbroek (short pants) beloved by Eastern Cape sheep farmers, who failed most of the class when we attempted AC theory, and then walked beaming into our introduction to Quantum Mechanics to tell us there was no such thing as an electron. \u201cAn electron is just a probability density wavefront moving through space\u201d he said, gleefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for a kind of reality we cannot directly perceive\u201d. I was badly hungover and had just failed his AC theory course \u2013 which is all about how electrons flow through circuits! \u2013 so it took me some time to calm down and appreciate the gravity of his words. Eventually, I sobered up, grasped what he was really saying and signed up to read a Masters in English Literature, hoping to understand the nature of metaphor itself more deeply. I wrote about ontological frameworks and singularity in the country I grew up in and love. It was an interesting experience: using language in order to take apart the ways in which I look at the world and then put them together again so as to reveal something else, some other story, some strange but fragrant song about how truth is still, always, singular . Though I Sang In My Chains But, our languages are also constrained. Ambiguous. We cannot think in ways which transcend spacetime \u2013 which is what would be necessary to describe the phenomenon fully \u2013 because natural language encodes meaning in sound, which propagates linearly through space, and so is always-already bound to time. I was caught in incompleteness once more. However, the other side of the limited language coin is that something as far-fetched as time travel is impossible only when the concept is arrived at through conventional linguistics. Arrival , the sci-fi movie, demonstrated this beautifully. The idea is simple, the result astounding: if you can encode meaning in ways independent of sound and therefore space, you can experience time itself in a radically different manner. It should be no surprise that the man who made up the alien language \u2013 which is circular and logographic \u2013 is none other than Stephen Wolfram, of wolfram|alpha fame. Wolfram is a personal hero of mine, calls himself a language designer and has been building the Wolfram Language for close on ten years, but is really just the latest in a long line of people who spent their lives looking for something like \u2018the perfect language\u2019. Perfect Language? The list stretches all the way back to the Ancient Greeks and likely beyond, but the man who really got the search kick-started more recently was named Gottfried Leibniz. Today, maths students around the world use Newton\u2019s Calculus, but Leibniz\u2019s notation, mostly because the man was obsessed with it and really knew what he was doing. He spent a lot of his time thinking about how we frame things, which sorts of ontological windows offered the most insight with the least complexity, and a bunch of other things ordinary people just never consider. There were many before Leibniz, like Raymond Lull, all detailed well by Umberto Eco in his book The Search for the Perfect Language , and many after him: Charles Babbage; Ada Lovelace; Alan Turing; Georg Cantor and Bertram Russell ; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien (and the rest of The Inklings); David Hilbert, C. G Jung ; and today, people like Diana Slattery and Stephen Wolfram. However, it was Leibniz who first suggested binary as a candidate for the perfect language. There was something about the mystical nature of 0 and 1 that hooked him. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 especially if you fall down the Diana Slattery, Xenolinguistics rabbit hole \u2013 there are many other ideas (apart from plain old binary) about what a perfect language might look like floating around out there. One that I particularly like is Scott Alexander\u2019s idea of Raikoth . It would be totally awesome to live in a world like that, at least in my opinion. The Art of Reading However, back in the \u201creal\u201d world, I quite like binary as a working candidate. In fact, I have spent a lot of time recently building simple frameworks for ordinary people to express themselves in a language which can be read as perfect by anyone who cares to interpret them. To paraphrase Vlad Zamfir, the \u201ccan be read\u201d part is in bold because it\u2019s important, but I\u2019ll circle back to it later. Software offers us a whole new class of languages which differ from natural language in that they use executable text to carry not just thought, but actions across the world at the speed of light. Moreover, they are externally verifiable and testable, and that is because \u2013 conceptually at least \u2013 programming languages are a bridge between mathematics and natural language and compile down to \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 binary, which computers can read. Why write a novel when I can build interactive, hypertext-based works which rely explicitly (rather than implicitly) on a given reader\u2019s actions? A little further afield, why write a poem about \u2013 for instance \u2013 wandering as lonely as a cloud, when I can build an immersive experience of just that in virtual reality, replete with believable blasts of wind? There are a few potential answers to these questions, but the larger point I want to make is that our languages have evolved to encode our myths onto silicon instead of just carbon. Right now, we are imprinting the same patterns that exist in our brains \u2013 what we might be tempted to call intelligence \u2013 onto a different substrate where, it is arguable, the continued evolution of consciousness will occur most rapidly*. Value and Meaning Now, in order for any language truly to express value \u2013 that is, for a language to have any meaning \u2013 it needs more than a shared substrate. Language needs a medium through which to flow. Natural language uses carbon as a substrate and us \u2013 human beings, the things Tom Robbins once described as \u201ca way water invented to transport itself between rivers\u201d \u2013 as its medium. However, programming languages have only a bunch of disparate computer protocols that often don\u2019t play nicely together as their medium. That is, until 2009. In the same way the programming languages not only carry thought, but action, across vast distances at the speed of light, Bitcoin was the first network and programming language that could not only carry value, but actually transfer it across vast distances far more quickly than we have ever been able to do before. That\u2019s awesome in and of itself, but \u2013 due to its limited scripting language \u2013 transferring value by means of sending cryptographically meaningful messages is pretty much all Bitcoin can do. Finally, Ethereum! Which brings us, at long last, to Ethereum. With a much richer internal scripting language , Ethereum can not only carry and transfer value, it can **define it dynamically by virtue of autonomous programs running in what can be imagined as a shared, global computer. Using binary as a working candidate for a perfect language works well because what really matters is how our language is interpreted* , i.e. how we are read by others around us. Well, we have a programmable substrate \u2013 silicon \u2013 on which binary is the native tongue and now * a programmable medium \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 which is both a shared, transactional history and a single, global computer capable of running linguistic programs made by humans. Reading from and writing to this network are well-defined operations that allow both humans and programs to communicate more efficiently and securely. The linguistic possibilities provided by a relatively new substrate running a completely new, consensus-based, cryptographically-secured, general computational medium are endless. This is where it gets really weird, though, because so far I\u2019ve only talked about language in a more or less human context. However, the programs on Ethereum can also talk to other programs and can \u2013 because they share the same, consensus-backed computer \u2013 transact between themselves. My good friend Simon de la Rouviere had this to say : \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful that programs will develop the desire to connect for the sake of it (like we do), unless we program them to do it. However, the benefits of knowing that a computation was verifiably done is like inventing religion for programs. Like the biological desire to know what\u2019s going on in others\u2019 minds, with verifiable computing protocols, a program will know the minds of other programs. Except, unlike biology, where it is imperfect, it will know exactly the state and processing capability. There\u2019s no longer this idea of servers of data and logic connected disparately through the network.\u201d Because blockchains fuse data and networks \u2013 i.e. everywhere there is data, there is network and everywhere there is network, there is data \u2013 and provide the results transparently to everyone, programming languages can be read by other programs and human beings in an essentially perfect way, if you take the term to indicate global consensus about the deterministic output of the program or account being read. Conclusion We live in a time where it is possible to tell stories that not only carry, but transfer, real value. It is therefore incumbent upon us to think more carefully than ever before about the forms we choose for our narratives, and the means by which we encode them into the world. Such stories, created in languages that compile down to binary run on a global computer, can literally alter the shared notion of history we are building together. If the thought of machines that can communicate in a language approaching the perfect , or global computers that are everywhere and nowhere and can\u2019t be switched off, or the advent of Artificial General Intelligence in such a context worries you, don\u2019t be alarmed, you\u2019re in good company. However, it is worth noting that a system like AlphaGo didn\u2019t end up destroying the game (read: art form) of Go by beating the world champion, Lee Sedol. Rather, in beating him, AlphaGo revealed a new range of artistic possibilities never before considered by humans. Moreover, through ongoing collaborations with the world\u2019s best players, AlphaGo \u2013 and the humans behind it \u2013 has advanced the game more in a year than in the last two thousand. We are learning together whole new ways to play . We need always to find constructive ways to use the tools we discover \u2013 that is the true nature of invention. I would argue that Satoshi Nakamoto set in motion the discovery of a whole set of new linguistic tools that we can use to help society reimagine what is valuable and how that is expressed, those two most fundamentally human actions. Furthermore, I would argue that trustless means of ensuring equitable distributions of value amongst people is \u2013 in fact \u2013 a prerequisite for a functional society that coexists with things like Artificial General Intelligence. It\u2019s heady stuff, and I drank the koolaid years ago, so please forgive my inevitable blind spots. I don\u2019t feel much different from that idealistic kid consumed by a desire to know it all, except that I no longer think in surface metaphors. Now it\u2019s something more like an old story I once heard: each thought a point of light; each containing a reflection of all the others, and themselves; each unutterably unique; each supporting the other by means of what is shared. *I don\u2019t want to get into the implied ethics of this, I just want to note that it is a very strong possibility, and therefore well worth thinking about . **The formal term is \u201c Turing-complete \u201d. Appendix There are a lot of links in this paper which I doubt most people will have the time to follow, so allow me to highlight just one of them, Gregory Chaitin\u2019s article on The Perfect Language . I suggest you read it for yourself, but it\u2019s very long, so here are some of the key, non-technical passages for people in a rush: \u201cThe crucial point is that knowing this language would be like having a key to universal knowledge. If you\u2019re a theologian, it would bring you closer, very close, to God\u2019s thoughts, which is dangerous. If you\u2019re a magician, it would give you magical powers. If you\u2019re a linguist, it would tell you the original, pure, uncorrupted language from which all languages descend [\u2026] Leibniz formulated a version of the search for the perfect language, which was firmly grounded in the magical, theological original idea, but which is also fit for consumption nowadays, that is, acceptable to modern ears, to contemporary scientists. This is a universal language, which he called the characteristica universalis , that was supposed to come with a crucial calculus ratiocinator. The idea is to reduce reasoning to calculation, to computation, because the most certain thing is that 2 + 5 = 7, and what is this if not a calculation? If two people have an intellectual dispute, Leibniz remarked, instead of dueling they could just sit down and say, \u201cGentlemen, let us compute!\u201d and get the correct answer, and find out who was right [\u2026] [\u2026 While, G\u00f6del in 1931 \u2013 and Alan Turing in 1936 \u2013 showed that you can\u2019t have a perfect language for mathematics , in Turing\u2019s work] you get another proof, a deeper proof of incompleteness, but you also get a kind of completeness. You find a perfect language. There is no perfect language for mathematical reasoning. G\u00f6del showed that in 1931, and Turing showed it again in 1936. But what Turing also showed in 1936 is that there are perfect languages, not for mathematical reasoning, but for computation , for specifying algorithms. What Turing discovered in 1936 is that there\u2019s a kind of completeness called universality and that there are universal Turing machines and universal programming languages. What universal means, what a universal programming language or a universal Turing machine is, is a language in which every possible algorithm can be written. On the one hand, Turing showed us in a deeper way that any language for mathematical reasoning has to be incomplete, but on the other hand, he showed us that languages for computation can be universal, which is just a synonym for completeness. There are perfect languages for computation, for writing algorithms, even though there aren\u2019t any perfect languages for mathematical reasoning [\u2026] Algorithmic information theory (AIT) goes further than Turing, and picks out, from Turing\u2019s universal languages, maximally expressive programming languages [\u2026] AIT has the notion of a maximally expressive programming language in which programs are maximally compact, and deals with a very basic complexity concept, which is the size of the smallest program to calculate something. Now we have a better notion of perfection. Universal programming languages are not all equally good. We concentrate on a subset, comprising the ones that enable us to write the most concise programs [\u2026] What we\u2019re asking is, how many yes/no decisions did God have to make to create something? \u2014 which is obviously a rather basic question to ask, if you consider that God is calculating the universe.

This other reality is always sending us hints which, without art, we can\u2019t receive.\" \u2014 Saul Bellow I have read many books in my life, searching for this \u2018other reality\u2019 scribbled out by various authors. I sought the secret everywhere and did the most silly things in my attempt to discover a way in. Until one day I stopped. Sincerely Singular Five years ago, I wrote a very boring thesis on sincerity, singularity, and the ability we have to design the ways in which we read and write. In it, I argued that \u201cself-conscious de-sign\u201d gives us the chance to break with the frame of representation which binds all linguistic effort. Basically, language is only a representation of a representation of the thing itself \u2013 it is always, at best, two steps removed from that which is. Music is a direct representation of that which is, hence all art aspires to the condition of music. However, if you use language in a self-conscious way, where the design of what you\u2019re saying and how you\u2019re saying it is inherently self-reflexive, you can de-sign the self; you can shift signification from the self-who-is-speaking to some larger and shared truth. Though this sounds complicated, there are historical examples. The Qur\u2019an is the best and most direct: it changed the way Arabs living around the year 632 could describe and relate to their being-in-the-world, primarily through the inspired shifting of pronouns between speaker and God, i.e. self-conscious de-sign. It is a language-event \u2013 a linguistic singularity \u2013 in that it offers people the chance to encounter reality in a way previously unimaginable. The Qur\u2019an, read sincerely, is a step function in that nebulous thing we like to call consciousness. To me, the Qur\u2019an is the ultimate step function, because it is encoded in language and so is infinitely dynamic while always containing a core meaning. It really is The Book of Truth. However, this does not mean that there have not been other singularities. I tried to show that singularity is not some specific point (i.e. when AGI surpasses human intelligence) after which nothing is the same: singularities occur regularly. The development of the printing press, for instance, was a mechanistic singularity. For the first time in modern Western history, the \u201cWord of God\u201d could be distributed widely to common people, in a language they could understand. This change in the hardware of civilisation gave people direct access to divine authority without needing the priest class to mediate. What happened in South Africa in 1994, when the oppressed collectively decided to forgive their oppressors \u2013 rather than following the route taken in Rwanda that same year \u2013 was a political singularity, led by a few great men and women who came out of prison with their ability to love somehow enhanced, and based on a shared philosophy we call ubuntu. It allowed us to encounter otherness, and live with it, in ways we\u2019re still trying to figure out. It is the reason I can write this today. The appearance of Bitcoin in 2009 represents a technological and financial singularity. It created consensus in distributed communications and so gives ordinary people the ability to decide between themselves what is valuable, and how that value can move, without needing bankers or governments to mediate. In fact, given that it has to do not with the vertical relationship of humanity to divinity, but with horizontal relationships between human beings \u2013 i.e. it is transactional, rather than mythological \u2013 it is set to have a bigger historical impact in this world than purely linguistic singularities. It is both a network and a language, both hardware and software, and we are only beginning to see the impact of executable language run on shared and ownerless public infrastructure; Ethereum being the current leader. A Grand Design Let's take a step back: singularity is one thing, but truth and design must still be defined. These terms played into my obsession with the opening line of Rian Malan\u2019s \u201cMy Traitor\u2019s Heart\u201d. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m burned out and starving to death, so I\u2019m just going to lay this all upon you and trust that you\u2019re a visionary reader, because the grand design, such as it is, is going to be hard for you to see.\u201d Wow. What is this \u2018grand design\u2019? Why is it so hard to see? Why does it require a visionary reader? I kept asking these questions as I read more and dived deeper into the knots of myself. Reading with inner vision \u2013 with the heart\u2019s eye \u2013 rather than academic division, requires sincerity. It is only if we take him at his word that we can recognise how Malan at once acknowledges that he can never tell the truth, yet his desire to have these bitter words heard as containing a truth which cannot be said is his ultimate truth . This is the grand design. This is the truth, and you can experience it . But as soon as I say it, truth disappears in the representation of a representation to which language is always limited. Unless you drop cynicism for a moment and read sincerely what is being written here. Salman Rushdie called Malan\u2019s work \u201ca triumphant instance of defeated love\u201d and this \u2013 for me \u2013 is the whole thing in one phrase. We will always be defeated by this temporal and limited world. It is what we come here to learn: how to submit and let go of that which does not belong to us. It is in this act of final and utter submission that we can, by grace, find the endless love which links it all together. That is the definition of eucatastrophe. As Rushdie wrote elsewhere: \u201cOne day, perhaps, the world may taste the pickles of history. They may be too strong for some palates, their smell may be overpowering, tears may rise to eyes; I hope nevertheless that it will be possible to say of them that they possess the authentic taste of truth . . . that they are, despite everything, acts of love.\u201d The Blue Book I stopped reading all these books written by others and set out to live the truth of my own existence. It is no small task to experience the utter insignificance of your short time here, and how infinitely precious you really are. Here\u2019s my truth, sincerely. Sometimes I am arrogant, sometimes I am humble; sometimes I am misleading, sometimes inspired. More often than not I feel like I\u2019m fumbling in the dark; just occasionally there is so much light I cannot see. Like Antjie Krog, the music of this broke-open life has become utterly haunting: \u201cAnd I wonder: God. Does he hear us? Does He know what our hearts are yearning for? That we all just want to be human \u2013 some with more colour, some with less, but all with air and sun. And I wade into song \u2013 in a language that is not mine, in a tongue I do not know. It is fragrant inside the song, and among the keynotes of sorrow and suffering there are soft silences where we who belong to this landscape, all of us, can come to rest. Sometimes the times we live in overflow with light.\u201d Having stopped reading such books, in a twist of irony \u2013 perhaps as a result of the romantic evenings of self when I go salsa dancing with my own confusion \u2013 I turned around and built one. The Blue Book is proof of the love I have experienced, as honestly and directly as I could express it. It is the defeated love of language, translated into digital form. You can read it in many media. Watch it expand through your browser to multiple sites of meaning as it promulgates the pattern of mind books have always carried across generations, while now also literally shifting your own search algorithms in \u201creal time\u201d. Really Living I specifically did not add any analytics to the The Blue Book site, so I have no idea how many people have read it. I don\u2019t imagine the number is very high. Which is expected: I did not write it for an audience. I wrote it as an act of devotion. I realise now that I also wrote it as a way of teaching myself what I really think it means to live a \u201cgood\u201d life. Though many greater minds have tried, I do not think what a \u201cgood\u201d life means can be condensed into some pithy phrase: it is about an iterative process; a living practice. I have found that the more I write what I have experienced in the form of honest poetry, the more my experience honestly becomes poetic. We design our world, and our world acts back to de-sign us. The two are in one continuous dialogue. \u201cWaking up\u201d is nothing other than learning how to tune in to that which is already being said between soul and self, Word and wor(l)d, way and wanderer. Looking back at The Blue Book now, I can see the obsession I had with the notion of a \u201cgrand design\u201d and the way it could be used to construct a \u201cproof\u201d. I both love and laugh at the part of me that (still) believes this. The book is almost baroque in its structure. Though the symphony is there if you know where to look, you really have to look and I am actually a great fan of simplicity. This is at odds with the challenge of fourteen cantos, followed by some Buddhist blues, a haiku harmony, and two final fugues. \u201cDo I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict myself.\u201d So I returned to a different, but equally important question in my thesis: what is it that actually gives value to human life, simply put? This ties into my \u2018professional\u2019 work on cryptocurrencies where the question of what generates value is endlessly debated. The answer most appropriate in the context of my own practice/life was there the whole time: love, trust, faith, and responsibility. Value As a means of wandering the middle way between Word and wor(l)d I began again, writing poems based on my experiences and then figuring out which of these four categories to slot them into. There is a natural progression from one to the other, you see. The first and most difficult step is to love. To love genuinely everything that is presented to you and take into your heart whatever is in front of you. To love completely the world you know, as if it were yourself (which it is, in one sense). Of course, this is easy to say and nearly impossible to do. Which is why we require trust. In order to love whatever is presented to you, you need to trust in the pattern of experience which has placed you in any given situation, be it blissful or barbaric. You need to trust that you are where you are meant to be; not because there\u2019s some Big Guy up there pulling all the strings, but simply because where you are is where you stand to learn the most about what \u2018love\u2019 actually means. Once again, when in blissful, poetic situations, this is easy to do. When faced with suffering and trauma and sadness, it is nearly impossible. So we require faith. This does not mean faith in something external to us \u2013 it is faith in the sense that Anthony Hopkins talks about it; a deep kind of knowing that we know nothing, that what we are is insignificant and passing, yet beneath it is something unchanging and miraculous. When your trust is truly tested, it is this kind of faith that withstands the forge of experience. Finally, having seen that everything emanates from One and will return to that same origin, with love as the unifying force between \u2013 and trust in the faith formed through all our experiences as that which gives us to see unity clearly \u2013 you need responsibility. The responsibility of not pushing your own truth onto others, but simply living it to its fullest and letting what overflows overflow, all the while acknowledging that it is not from you. You do not exist, after all. Here is the root of true, humble responsibility. As this project progressed, I realised that the poems were, indeed, overflowing and that I needed some other categories to hold them. My thesis is five years old, and I have hopefully grown some since writing it. So, I looked at what I was experiencing as a result of waking up each day with the conscious awareness that I would try and live the highest ideals of what I had written (what had been written for me), and slowly two other categories emerged: joy and peace. Joy must be handled with care. It is not ecstasy or bliss, but the song of one who knows that the whole thing \u2013 all the universe \u2013 is constantly in worship whether a specific part acknowledges it or not. It is the joy of never being able to change that, but accepting the option to sing along. The joy of adding our voice to the timeless chorus we have been given the possibility of hearing, if only we would learn to wait well enough in the wake of God\u2019s endless silence. It is not the soaring of your heart; it is its quiet beat within the body\u2019s boundaries; pointing always at that which is boundless. At last, peace: the gateway to true knowledge of what is. This peace passes all understanding. Endlessly Living The Blue Book presents my experience of what it is that really gives value to human life. It is, for now, \u201cthe root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life\u201d as I have known it, in my limited and flawed ways. It is my attempt to express this truth relatably, using more accessible categories and without trying to force it on anyone (it\u2019s just a subdomain, after all). Like its predecessor, it will live quietly online; in git ; and on IPFS , waiting for true readers to find it and decode all its many dimensions (from the commit trail , to the time-encoding links , to the poetry itself and all its many traces ). Unlike its predecessor, it uses YouTube\u2019s API to pass social information in addition to time, so now you\u2019ll find specific comments highlighted for some video traces. As someone else says: \u201cThe comment section is where I can find people with the same vibes. Love and peace to all. Enjoy the life trip.\u201d This is really just an extension of an idea central to The Blue Book: that I can only get close to saying what I really mean through using other\u2019s distinct voices. If it\u2019s not just me saying it, then such works become ours. And it is this obviously fictional our which is the lie that can hopefully reveal to you the truth of what you are, where you come from, and what we are here to do. If we really do come from One, then telling the whole truth will require every human voice. I trust that, one day, I will participate in that with you.","title":"Living"},{"location":"essays/living-essay/#living-the-essay","text":"\u201cThere is another reality, the genuine one, which we lose sight of.

In it, I argued that \u201cself-conscious de-sign\u201d gives us the chance to break with the frame of representation which binds all linguistic effort. Basically, language is only a representation of a representation of the thing itself \u2013 it is always, at best, two steps removed from that which is. Music is a direct representation of that which is, hence all art aspires to the condition of music. However, if you use language in a self-conscious way, where the design of what you\u2019re saying and how you\u2019re saying it is inherently self-reflexive, you can de-sign the self; you can shift signification from the self-who-is-speaking to some larger and shared truth. Though this sounds complicated, there are historical examples. The Qur\u2019an is the best and most direct: it changed the way Arabs living around the year 632 could describe and relate to their being-in-the-world, primarily through the inspired shifting of pronouns between speaker and God, i.e. self-conscious de-sign.

I am not done with my changes. This is part of a favourite poem of mine ; favourite because of the economy of language coupled with the infinitude of the poet\u2019s ideas. In just 44 lines, Kunitz covers life, death, friendship, family, god and the angels, the heart, \u201cthe turn\u201d, art, fate, and the self. After sweeping us across this vast vista, the poet steps aside and offers some really simple advice, in a voice not his own: \u201cLive in the layers,/ not on the the litter.\u201d Having crafted a clever linguistic twist, Kunitz declares his human limitation, his humility: that his \u201cart\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. this art we are reading right now, this poem right before us, which lays it all out\u200a\u2014\u200acannot decipher the real message. By declaring his inadequacy, even after getting out of his own way, the poem and poet perform incompleteness : a fundamental building block of our universe. However, natural language (and poetry especially, as \u201clanguage against which we have no defense\u201d) offers us a solution not available to mathematicians and cryptographers. The poem is only like ciphertext, flowing from somewhere beyond the poet and his art\u2026 What else could be required to decrypt it but you , and your inborn ability to interpret; to observe performance? You are the key; reading the ritual. Further down the rabbit hole and there are also many different layers of observation to be explored, even in these last 8 lines. The poet\u2019s \u201cbook of transformations/ is already written\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahis fate sealed, even before the arrival of a new voice he lacks the art to decipher. The final line can be read as strengthening this assertion: he is not done with his changes because there are yet more pages already written in his book of transformations. However, we can also read it very differently, rendered as two distinct and juxtaposed ideas: his book is already written, but the poet has the ability to edit his own changes, to leave (at the very least) marginalia and other hurried marks that change grammar or repair syntax and make the overall meaning more clear. Such poetic edits\u200a\u2014\u200alike all marginalia\u200a\u2014\u200aamount to adding layers to a text, altering one\u2019s own changes while still moving within the total river of transformation to which we are all subject. They reveal how more than one mind moved through this particular forest of symbols, forging a different path to finish at the same point. We may not control fate, but perhaps it is possible to direct it by living in the editorial layers: not fighting inevitable change, but using direct and meaningful language like poetry to implement our own changes in dialogue with all this changing life, like so much litter left behind by less attentive souls. Change Without Change I work in an industry obsessed with change and disruption. This is sometimes a blessing, because it can make people more conscious about what it is that they would really like to see change, though many continue blindly to rip out pages simply for the sake of being noticed. The more subtle point about poetic edits to the book of transformation is that they must be carefully considered from many different layers of abstraction (not just observation) if they are ever to produce more happiness than suffering. This is the key natural language offers that maths and science cannot.

I am not done with my changes. This is part of a favourite poem of mine ; favourite because of the economy of language coupled with the infinitude of the poet\u2019s ideas. In just 44 lines, Kunitz covers life, death, friendship, family, god and the angels, the heart, \u201cthe turn\u201d, art, fate, and the self. After sweeping us across this vast vista, the poet steps aside and offers some really simple advice, in a voice not his own: \u201cLive in the layers,/ not on the the litter.\u201d Having crafted a clever linguistic twist, Kunitz declares his human limitation, his humility: that his \u201cart\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. this art we are reading right now, this poem right before us, which lays it all out\u200a\u2014\u200acannot decipher the real message. By declaring his inadequacy, even after getting out of his own way, the poem and poet perform incompleteness : a fundamental building block of our universe. However, natural language (and poetry especially, as \u201clanguage against which we have no defense\u201d) offers us a solution not available to mathematicians and cryptographers. The poem is only like ciphertext, flowing from somewhere beyond the poet and his art\u2026 What else could be required to decrypt it but you , and your inborn ability to interpret; to observe performance? You are the key; reading the ritual. Further down the rabbit hole and there are also many different layers of observation to be explored, even in these last 8 lines. The poet\u2019s \u201cbook of transformations/ is already written\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahis fate sealed, even before the arrival of a new voice he lacks the art to decipher. The final line can be read as strengthening this assertion: he is not done with his changes because there are yet more pages already written in his book of transformations. However, we can also read it very differently, rendered as two distinct and juxtaposed ideas: his book is already written, but the poet has the ability to edit his own changes, to leave (at the very least) marginalia and other hurried marks that change grammar or repair syntax and make the overall meaning more clear. Such poetic edits\u200a\u2014\u200alike all marginalia\u200a\u2014\u200aamount to adding layers to a text, altering one\u2019s own changes while still moving within the total river of transformation to which we are all subject. They reveal how more than one mind moved through this particular forest of symbols, forging a different path to finish at the same point. We may not control fate, but perhaps it is possible to direct it by living in the editorial layers: not fighting inevitable change, but using direct and meaningful language like poetry to implement our own changes in dialogue with all this changing life, like so much litter left behind by less attentive souls.","title":"Reading As Layered Ritual"},{"location":"essays/reading-as-layered-ritual/#change-without-change","text":"I work in an industry obsessed with change and disruption. This is sometimes a blessing, because it can make people more conscious about what it is that they would really like to see change, though many continue blindly to rip out pages simply for the sake of being noticed. The more subtle point about poetic edits to the book of transformation is that they must be carefully considered from many different layers of abstraction (not just observation) if they are ever to produce more happiness than suffering. This is the key natural language offers that maths and science cannot.

The study of reality is called ontology ; the study of what we know about reality is called epistemology . It may seem silly to use such big and unnecessary words, but reflecting clearly on the difference between what is , and what we know about it is the foundation of this essay. One of the most powerful linguistic frameworks we have for making this distinction technically is something called Bayes\u2019 Theorem , which has to do with calculating probabilities. Lies, Damn Lies, And Statistics Using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we can describe quantitatively the difference between prediction (about reality and what actually happened/happens/will happen next) and inference (our knowledge about reality and how it constantly changes). Even if you\u2019re not a statistician and couldn\u2019t care less about the probable, knowing that there is a difference between reality and our knowledge of it allows us to clear up some seeming paradoxes. For instance, Einstein famously rejected much of quantum mechanics because of something he called \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d or what is now called \u201centanglement\u201d. Basically, if we put two subatomic particles in the same state, then separate them and measure one such that it\u2019s probability wave function collapses; then the same must happen instantaneously to the other particle, no matter the distance which separates them. This means that the information about our measurement must somehow travel faster than light, which violates cosmic law as we know it, and therefore upset Albert. However, it is not information which travels faster than light, but our logical inference . Imagine you have a bag with 2 balls in it. There is 1 white ball and 1 red ball. If I pick a ball out and don\u2019t tell you what it is, that doesn\u2019t change your knowledge of what colour ball will appear next. But, if I pick another ball out and tell you it is white, then you can also make an accurate inference about what colour the first ball was (you know it was red). \u2018Measuring\u2019 the colour of the second ball changes your knowledge about what colour the first ball might have been, but it does not magically affect its colour when I actually picked it out. It is time-independent ideas we are concerned with when calculating probabilities. All The Time And No Time At All Another, more literary, way of saying this is that ideas \u2013 our knowledge about reality \u2013 exist independently of time and space, and therefore can be applied across it at the same \u2018instant\u2019 without violating any laws precisely because they do not exist within spacetime in any meaningful way. I think that\u2019s enormously cool. It explains why books are magical time-travel machines, just as it hints at the mechanism behind singularities (scientific and those of social consciousness). However, the big problem is still to be faced. In order to share any idea, we have to describe it in some kind of language. And our languages are always-already bound to time (see Arrival ). It is this condition of linguistic description which forces ideas to withstand the \u201ctest of the real\u201d in order to gain any lasting significance. If we return to the ontological level, though, we can see that any \u201ctest of the real\u201d as we perceive it must itself be uncertain and incomplete (thanks, Heisenberg and G\u00f6del). This may seem confusing, but is ultimately the scientific grounds for creativity. It is the little wiggle room between what is and how you relate to it which defines who you are and what you mean . Models and Metaphors In terms of our knowledge about reality : once there is conscious awareness of a pattern anywhere, that awareness is \u2018everywhere\u2019. Ideas are not bound by time and space; only their descriptions are. However, description is exactly how ideas interface with reality: an idea that is never shared cannot be measured in an ontologically meaningful way. The world\u2019s in our head must be reproducible by others through interpretation if they are to matter. Here is the great trick: thought is a pattern that has the potential to \u2018describe\u2019 the patterns which constitute thought, though there are ontological and linguistic limits to the impact description can have on reality . However, that strangely loopy sentence , while seeming to describe a limit on thought, simultaneously performs the fact that these limits can be played with through the languages you employ to construct your model! The play is always centred on making your epistemology as general and extensible as possible. Ironically, you can only achieve this by paying precise, ontological attention to the primitives which make it all up. Primitives designed to express probability make Bayes\u2019 Theorem a more suitable linguistic tool for understanding Quantum Mechanics than English or German. Moreover, using a particular framework appropriate to probabilistic reality as the primary tool for constructing our mental model results in a clearer description of the critical concepts at the more general level of English or German, too. Magic! It\u2019s All About The View Another way of thinking about this is that you want to choose your primitives for communication in such a way that they not only describe as succinctly and accurately as possible the kind of reality you\u2019re interested in measuring, but also so that they can find meaningful application in as many different interpretations, or \u2018views\u2019, of the results as can be constructed. This was one of the core ideas behind Doug Engelbart\u2019s work on NLS, and The Mother of All Demos . By constructing as many views (epistemologies) of the same data (ontology) as we need, and by building into the interface the ability for anyone to make or alter any view they please, we can build \u201ccyclical augmentation systems for collaboration\u201d at scales never before seen. We can equip people to navigate the stored knowledge of our entire species in new ways, which is directly equivalent to describing consciousness more broadly. This, to me, has always been the real promise of computing. Which brings us, finally, to The Blue Book . While many of the ideas from Engelbart (and Alan Kay, and Vannevar Bush, and Ted Nelson, and Tim Berners-Lee) still haven\u2019t been applied, there are ways to think about using the internet itself as the User System Engelbart described in NLS; and using links between different sites (or views) as linguistic primitives for describing the \u2018reality\u2019 of a hyperconnected, modern life experience. The Blue Book exists as a website ; a YouTube playlist ; a Spotify list for when you\u2019re on the go; a GitHub repository with source code and all the public commits and data that go along with it; a GoodReads list you can not only see reference material on, but also purchase it from; AND as the social conversations that have sprung up, or that are woven into it through its many other links. Admittedly, this is a very poor approximation of what the research at Xerox PARC (and elsewhere) was aimed at, but it is an approximation nonetheless, using only open source tools that are available today.

There is nothing. You either have water, or you do not have water.\u201d We lapsed into silence as the stoked embers settled once more into a regular rhyme of red and orange. \u201cFollow anything for long enough, truly, and you will come to its opposite.\u201d The fire murmured its soft agreement as I lay back to watch the past play out. \u201cThere is no such thing as non-fiction,\u201d you continued, after some time. \u201cThere is only reality, and words. Between these two is nothing. Follow either far enough, though, and you might one day find that first Word which was with God, and was God.\u201d Your voice played gently with the old idea as if it were a childhood friend. It also sounded, though, something like eternity, as if a great battle were just beginning and it had already cost you everything you were to come back from the frontlines and tell the story of that no-man\u2019s-land. To describe \u2013 even for a moment \u2013 the territory so that eager cartographers could eavesdrop and try to draw their own crude maps. So that the world could take back, piece by carved up piece, your small offering until no bit of it remained and another would have to go back and find the secret in a line now long forgotten. We lay there, like so many dreamers have for untold generations, watching the silk flames and singing carbon and distant furnaces of the past above us, strung out in a giant map that somehow holds a hint about what it is to burn up and become again like air and heat and dancing light. We lay there watching the world turn; an old top \u2013 fashioned long ago and with great care \u2013 set spinning in endless space, suspended in a sunbeam, as if to remind us that this is the dream. That being here, for even one brief moment, is the greatest piece of fiction we each get to weave. There is no such thing as non-fiction: only stories which stitch this together, and those that break it open to reveal the bloody heart of the thing, broken and bruised and all the more beautiful because of it, because it somehow refuses to stop beating, even here \u2013 at the great world\u2019s end. Still a deep blue at the fire\u2019s centre, if you look at it from this angle, between those two pieces of wood. See? See how colour, too, is simply a composition of heat, or wavelength, or frequency depending on which layer you want to look at. \u201cThe story insists on being told,\u201d you whispered, watching the fire burn down. \u201cAnd we keeper\u2019s laid out here in the old dark \u2013 drawn back by forces we cannot comprehend, bar that they ask for things far beyond our own endurance \u2013 bound always to search for the words that will keep this dream top spinning, will keep that star beam focussed here.\u201d Strange, isn\u2019t it?

Or \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky \u2013 perhaps the fine sea sand on Cinsta beach, ground down by the endless Indian Ocean since soon after the world began. We knew \u2013 lying there in the pregnant night listening to the slowed-down songs of cicadas hidden in her folds \u2013 that now is not a moment in time. Though we are made of time, consumed by time, burnt up by time like smoke from a woody fire \u2013 there are riverine dimensions to our being which flow with the benediction of water over all these grainy clicks. Some carried to drift forever across the sands of our Great Face and dance in the brief summer rains, others caught in the rocks and washed in perfect circles for ten thousand lives. Just so that you, walking along the ocean\u2019s edge, might occasionally find an odd gift: all irregular bar a single, straight hole the size of a pencil right through the hard stone\u2019s center. As if whoever had drawn this world into being had slipped just then, stuck the instrument through the canvas and left a gap wide enough to see through. As if this were the first Word you had ever really found, right here in your palm. Wholly yours, having spent so long swirling in the cracks, carving out a perfect shape with your imperfections. You chuckled softly, rolling over to gaze back into the fire. \u201cYes,\u201d you said, looking through the shimmering haze of heat at me, \u201cthe greatest stories we can tell are not love stories, though those come close.\u201d I mimicked your movements, digging my hip slightly deeper into the earth to find a more comfortable position. \u201cThe greatest stories are pure celebration .\u201d \u201cTo celebrate the sun is to make it rise again each dawn.

Come back to wash your feet and dip your head in holy oil so that you might wait \u2013 again \u2013 at the end of that stony garden, beyond the lines of olive trees, and accept with love the beat\u2019s betrayal, because the kingdom is already here. It always was. It always will be. Live here. Look! Take a step or two back so you see this small lake in the middle of a city park holding the half moon in it\u2019s still hands as the starlings sing themselves into a sunset swarm, a swirling murmuration swelling to meet the music between things. All this love in endless layers: so lose your self forever. Love that feels like light and lives in darkness. Love that builds you up and breaks you, utterly. Love like life and well beyond death. Love as mysterious and obvious as gravity. Love like the verb it is. Love as lyrically as our first language. Love without any sound at all. Love bounded by this one life.

Passengers and cargo rumbled past on parallel lines which made the soft ground shake and dance. Tiny frozen pellets piled next to the door shocked into springing life, resonating with the mighty, metal wheels of England. Always turning. I would lie awake late at night, feeling each passing train, trying to guess how long it was, what it was carrying, where it was going. My mind would fall into rhythm with the shaking bed, carried far into blackness, always with those twin lines leading forth, faintly captured in the train\u2019s headlights. The sound invaded my dreams, giving everything a mechanical, pulse-like feel. People spoke in staccato, waiting for the blinking red lights before proceeding, before unloading any of their hoarded cargo kept locked up in massive steel shipping containers. Sometimes, back in reality, I would ride the lines myself, marvelling at the passing countryside; the still lanes and old runes in the distance \u2013 overgrown and crumbling. The mighty fallen into quiet fields and meadows where cows and sheep grazed, heads bent before the endless cloud. It felt like riding time back and forth, only the quiet whir of metal on metal and the odd screech of brakes to mark the passing moments, which seemed to get mixed up in late night stations built like great warehouses with a single clock hanging in the centre, firmly dictating its terms. It was so easy. Gliding through domesticated lands to a strict timetable, everyone normalised to the system, swiping cards and tickets, hopping on and off. Just another day of an endless, mostly grey, procession. I went to visit my family for Christmas that year. My uncle and aunt had got divorced when I was young, so I barely remembered her. I just had a collection of stories and half-hinted at truths and lies from which I had built a composite picture around an empty name. She turned out to be nothing like what I had made up in my mind, for stories do not capture people; they capture the moments which people are doomed to outlast. It turns out that the stories we never get told are always far more interesting. It took two parallel tracks made of time itself to teach me that. After Christmas dinner she went digging in a forgotten corner of her office. She came back bearing three albums in both her arms, tentatively cradled sepia memories, guarded by dust covers and layers of the other life she had come to lead for the last twenty years. The albums were made up of her and my uncle\u2019s wedding photographs. Gazing out from the still lifes of young and carefree people were both my parents, exactly the same age as I was on that cold and wet Christmas Eve. \u201cYou don\u2019t look much like your dad,\u201d my aunt mused, running her fingers over a photograph of the four of them together, smiling widely, flowers in the woman\u2019s hair and the breast pockets of my dad and his brother. \u201cBut, when I heard you talking in the entrance hall, I could have sworn he had come back just like he was all those years ago.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say. I just looked at the four people so young I could barely recognise them. So full of life and joy and expectancy of what was to come. My grandparents are there, standing straight and tall at the marriage of their first son. My grandad\u2019s arms around his boys\u2019 shoulders, a picture of pride. My grandmother, breathtakingly beautiful, austere, graceful, mixes among the blossoms and flowers, wearing a grand hat that gives her, as ever, an air of mystery. A woman living fiercely on her own terms. At least, that\u2019s how I like to imagine her. And my dad\u2019s younger brother, he was there too. Already half-fleeing from the frame. No-one ever talks about it. He stands at the edges, blond hair contrasting with his older brothers\u2019 thick, brown side-partings, flopping over his eyes as the breeze blows gently past. His smile is the goofiest of the three and there\u2019s some rare spark in his half-hidden eyes, something I\u2019ve not seen before. Did he know what was coming? What would have been the colour of that knowledge? He seems carefree, happy, completely at ease in this strange night. I sat there until early the next morning, paging through each memory, trying to imagine what it was like to be there, to have known my parents when they were my age. When they were young and stupid and naive and head-over-heels in love as the spring bloomed and rapt couples danced in the hall, doors flung open to let in the soft night. Trying to imagine the parts of the chapel the pictures don\u2019t show, the late night dancing that seems to have disappeared from the photographic evidence. At the very end was a pile of extra photos, not placed into folders. Left-overs from history, unassigned. No words to compose the correct remembrance of all that cut off time. Christmas ended and I returned to the tracks, following them over the horizon and back to my flat. I was addicted, you see; couldn\u2019t get enough of the sense of going back on myself, finding all the stories that lead to me, here, now, which I had never heard before. I felt like they would be right around the bend, waiting for intrepid time travellers to be lulled to sleep and into the regulated dreams of railway lines. Some months later I travelled down to London to meet my godparents. My godfather and my dad had been best friend\u2019s for more than thirty years, had served in the army together when conscription was still enforced under apartheid, had climbed the corporate ladder together after completing their service. They go way back. Often I\u2019ve heard him tell stories about my dad \u2013 about how badly he used to drive his mini; about how they would get drunk in the Hillbrow Hotel, set the fire alarm off and then hose down the customers as they piled out in panic; about what a brilliantly intelligent man my dad is. Over brunch, I got him to tell me about their time together in the army. There are some moments in history that are just unknowable. What it was like to be young in the summer of 1939 in London or Berlin; or in the violent, death-strewn South Africa of the 1980\u2019s is truly unimaginable. There\u2019s something which stops full knowledge of that time, some barrier the mind can\u2019t overcome in its attempt to render it believably. Yet, over orange juice and the full English, my godfather told me the story of my dad and one night in barracks. Both of them were older than most of the men in the regiment, having been through university, so there was a somewhat strange relationship between them and the officers. The officers respected them, used their cars on weekends, listened to their advice, but nevertheless outranked them. On this particular night, South Africa was exploding under increasingly harsh repression from the government. Their regiment was ordered to make ready to move into Sebokeng, a particularly violent township which was, at the time, pretty much engulfed in street war. My dad refused. It feels strange to write that, to try and imagine him standing in some bare barracks, a private staring at an officer, refusing to obey a direct order. It\u2019s tempting to see him standing tall, speaking calmly with steel emanating from his green eyes. A hero. I\u2019m sure if I asked him about it, he would say that it wasn\u2019t like that, that it was more a question of what he felt he could and could not do, rather than standing up to the apartheid government. That he was scared. That he was young and heedless, too, then. That life is just one thing after another and we can never know which moments will mean everything and which nothing, nor which photos and stories our kids will one day sift through, looking for the real person behind \u2018dad\u2019. The regiment ended up standing down, baffled by the rooinek who refused to fight. My godfather told me another story after that, about one of their friends who had actually gone into the township some time earlier. He went into Soweto on the day of Steve Biko\u2019s funeral, to stand guard at the stadium where it was being held. The country was alight, literally milliseconds away from civil war. I don\u2019t feel he was exaggerating when he told me that, had shots been fired at Biko\u2019s funeral, they would have been the death knells of any kind of democratic settlement which, as it stood, was still more than a decade away. Having never fired his R-1, the friend took up position watching the angry mourners march past, defiance etched into their faces, their fists, their songs, their sadness. Suddenly, about halfway through the day, a young boy appeared from nowhere and threw a burning dog into his hands. He dropped his gun as he groped to put out the flames. Luckily, nothing happened after that, or maybe everything happened after that. Who can tell? The boy looked at him for a long time and then walked away. As I finished my eggs, I heard about how close we really came to full war on a day in 1977, and about how my father sat in his barracks, refusing to bear arms against his own countrymen when it came to be his turn. What did apartheid do to those young men, bearing burning dogs and shooting unarmed children? How did we recover? Did we recover? Time haunts us, as we fly back and forth between memory and \u2018real life\u2019, twin tracks tracing each other; always separated as they stretch behind and before us. Shaking every time a train rumbles over. Singing strange, metallic melodies to rhythms we don\u2019t always recognise. There\u2019s a photo of my dad above my parents bed, framed in white by my mom. It\u2019s my favourite. He\u2019s staring down along the beach \u2013 wind gusting through his thinning and grey hair \u2013 our old German Shepherd standing next to him, ears to attention. He seems absorbed in some memory, some fleeting thought of lives passed, each leaving its mark in his green eyes. In the background, the deep blue Indian Ocean stretches on forever.","title":"Father Time"},{"location":"prose/father-time/#father-time","text":"For a year I lived next to the train tracks.

The mighty fallen into quiet fields and meadows where cows and sheep grazed, heads bent before the endless cloud. It felt like riding time back and forth, only the quiet whir of metal on metal and the odd screech of brakes to mark the passing moments, which seemed to get mixed up in late night stations built like great warehouses with a single clock hanging in the centre, firmly dictating its terms. It was so easy. Gliding through domesticated lands to a strict timetable, everyone normalised to the system, swiping cards and tickets, hopping on and off. Just another day of an endless, mostly grey, procession. I went to visit my family for Christmas that year. My uncle and aunt had got divorced when I was young, so I barely remembered her. I just had a collection of stories and half-hinted at truths and lies from which I had built a composite picture around an empty name. She turned out to be nothing like what I had made up in my mind, for stories do not capture people; they capture the moments which people are doomed to outlast. It turns out that the stories we never get told are always far more interesting. It took two parallel tracks made of time itself to teach me that. After Christmas dinner she went digging in a forgotten corner of her office. She came back bearing three albums in both her arms, tentatively cradled sepia memories, guarded by dust covers and layers of the other life she had come to lead for the last twenty years. The albums were made up of her and my uncle\u2019s wedding photographs. Gazing out from the still lifes of young and carefree people were both my parents, exactly the same age as I was on that cold and wet Christmas Eve. \u201cYou don\u2019t look much like your dad,\u201d my aunt mused, running her fingers over a photograph of the four of them together, smiling widely, flowers in the woman\u2019s hair and the breast pockets of my dad and his brother. \u201cBut, when I heard you talking in the entrance hall, I could have sworn he had come back just like he was all those years ago.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say. I just looked at the four people so young I could barely recognise them. So full of life and joy and expectancy of what was to come. My grandparents are there, standing straight and tall at the marriage of their first son. My grandad\u2019s arms around his boys\u2019 shoulders, a picture of pride. My grandmother, breathtakingly beautiful, austere, graceful, mixes among the blossoms and flowers, wearing a grand hat that gives her, as ever, an air of mystery. A woman living fiercely on her own terms. At least, that\u2019s how I like to imagine her. And my dad\u2019s younger brother, he was there too. Already half-fleeing from the frame. No-one ever talks about it. He stands at the edges, blond hair contrasting with his older brothers\u2019 thick, brown side-partings, flopping over his eyes as the breeze blows gently past. His smile is the goofiest of the three and there\u2019s some rare spark in his half-hidden eyes, something I\u2019ve not seen before. Did he know what was coming? What would have been the colour of that knowledge? He seems carefree, happy, completely at ease in this strange night. I sat there until early the next morning, paging through each memory, trying to imagine what it was like to be there, to have known my parents when they were my age. When they were young and stupid and naive and head-over-heels in love as the spring bloomed and rapt couples danced in the hall, doors flung open to let in the soft night. Trying to imagine the parts of the chapel the pictures don\u2019t show, the late night dancing that seems to have disappeared from the photographic evidence. At the very end was a pile of extra photos, not placed into folders. Left-overs from history, unassigned. No words to compose the correct remembrance of all that cut off time. Christmas ended and I returned to the tracks, following them over the horizon and back to my flat. I was addicted, you see; couldn\u2019t get enough of the sense of going back on myself, finding all the stories that lead to me, here, now, which I had never heard before. I felt like they would be right around the bend, waiting for intrepid time travellers to be lulled to sleep and into the regulated dreams of railway lines. Some months later I travelled down to London to meet my godparents. My godfather and my dad had been best friend\u2019s for more than thirty years, had served in the army together when conscription was still enforced under apartheid, had climbed the corporate ladder together after completing their service. They go way back. Often I\u2019ve heard him tell stories about my dad \u2013 about how badly he used to drive his mini; about how they would get drunk in the Hillbrow Hotel, set the fire alarm off and then hose down the customers as they piled out in panic; about what a brilliantly intelligent man my dad is. Over brunch, I got him to tell me about their time together in the army. There are some moments in history that are just unknowable. What it was like to be young in the summer of 1939 in London or Berlin; or in the violent, death-strewn South Africa of the 1980\u2019s is truly unimaginable. There\u2019s something which stops full knowledge of that time, some barrier the mind can\u2019t overcome in its attempt to render it believably. Yet, over orange juice and the full English, my godfather told me the story of my dad and one night in barracks. Both of them were older than most of the men in the regiment, having been through university, so there was a somewhat strange relationship between them and the officers. The officers respected them, used their cars on weekends, listened to their advice, but nevertheless outranked them. On this particular night, South Africa was exploding under increasingly harsh repression from the government. Their regiment was ordered to make ready to move into Sebokeng, a particularly violent township which was, at the time, pretty much engulfed in street war. My dad refused. It feels strange to write that, to try and imagine him standing in some bare barracks, a private staring at an officer, refusing to obey a direct order. It\u2019s tempting to see him standing tall, speaking calmly with steel emanating from his green eyes. A hero. I\u2019m sure if I asked him about it, he would say that it wasn\u2019t like that, that it was more a question of what he felt he could and could not do, rather than standing up to the apartheid government. That he was scared. That he was young and heedless, too, then. That life is just one thing after another and we can never know which moments will mean everything and which nothing, nor which photos and stories our kids will one day sift through, looking for the real person behind \u2018dad\u2019. The regiment ended up standing down, baffled by the rooinek who refused to fight. My godfather told me another story after that, about one of their friends who had actually gone into the township some time earlier. He went into Soweto on the day of Steve Biko\u2019s funeral, to stand guard at the stadium where it was being held. The country was alight, literally milliseconds away from civil war. I don\u2019t feel he was exaggerating when he told me that, had shots been fired at Biko\u2019s funeral, they would have been the death knells of any kind of democratic settlement which, as it stood, was still more than a decade away. Having never fired his R-1, the friend took up position watching the angry mourners march past, defiance etched into their faces, their fists, their songs, their sadness. Suddenly, about halfway through the day, a young boy appeared from nowhere and threw a burning dog into his hands. He dropped his gun as he groped to put out the flames. Luckily, nothing happened after that, or maybe everything happened after that. Who can tell? The boy looked at him for a long time and then walked away. As I finished my eggs, I heard about how close we really came to full war on a day in 1977, and about how my father sat in his barracks, refusing to bear arms against his own countrymen when it came to be his turn. What did apartheid do to those young men, bearing burning dogs and shooting unarmed children? How did we recover? Did we recover? Time haunts us, as we fly back and forth between memory and \u2018real life\u2019, twin tracks tracing each other; always separated as they stretch behind and before us. Shaking every time a train rumbles over. Singing strange, metallic melodies to rhythms we don\u2019t always recognise. There\u2019s a photo of my dad above my parents bed, framed in white by my mom. It\u2019s my favourite. He\u2019s staring down along the beach \u2013 wind gusting through his thinning and grey hair \u2013 our old German Shepherd standing next to him, ears to attention. He seems absorbed in some memory, some fleeting thought of lives passed, each leaving its mark in his green eyes. In the background, the deep blue Indian Ocean stretches on forever.","title":"Father Time"},{"location":"prose/rivers-of-you/","text":"Rivers of You It thunders through me, like I remember it always doing.

Walking out later to watch the stars dance on tiny wavelets in the night wind over sand and mirrors and so much past.
