# Spring Free

We walked out at spring tide, the sand still  
saturated by the retreating sea so that  
you could literally see the stars –  
Sirius there on the beach, blinking –   
singing somehow the never ending music  
of a whole ocean drawn back by  
forces we so frequently forget,  
all of it to unveil – for a moment –  
what Orion looks like reversed  
on this first mirror.  
  
How can you say that we have not known  
magic?  
  
How can you walk with me here,  
on the edge of myth itself, the stars  
pointers to an endless story, longer  
than the expanse before us, with more  
words than grains of sand beneath  
our tired feet, soaking up again  
the charge of what is bigger,  
and not know that you are this?  
  
That you _are_ me?  
  
That we breathe each other  
as we create the world before us;  
that require _this_ world  
to create at all?  
  
Can you touch the cold water  
and coarse grain of the thing?  
Can you answer yet what it feels like  
to walk on sky? To wander between  
the past as the waves crash on,  
further out than we’ve ever been before.
