    "content": "a beautiful question “except i shall see in his hands the print of nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, i will not believe.” — the apostle thomas in 2015, a quiet and reserved man walked into a wood-panelled room in oxford and gave a presentation. it was on science and perspective and beauty. his name is frank wilczek. he spoke slowly, with long pauses between thoughts as if trying to fit his hard-won truth into less than two hours was a task the difficulty of which few mortals could conceive, let alone complete. and yet, a grand picture emerged between all the slow sentences, as if the ineffable could be spoken of, could be sidled up to using pure symbol and just one question, sculpted from the lumps of rough stone we find strewn along our way through this one wild and precious life. does nature embody beautiful ideas? like all great queries, it is its simplicity that acts as a key capable of unlocking doors you didn’t know were there. five everyday words – worker words with blue collars, blurted out by just about anybody – can be used to build an artifice, a work of art, that will let you gaze in wonder at the never-ending pattern which plays across our mind each day. numbering the harmonies this version of the story starts with pythagoras, who believed that all things are number, because he managed to show how not only shape (in the case of triangles), but also length and tension or weight (in the case of musical strings) are related through number to harmony. the world of mind and the world of matter influence one another, profoundly, and this was already enough – more than 2,000 years ago – to anchor a mystical worldview. the greeks, however, were not able to answer the inevitable follow-up to pythagoras’ discoveries, namely; why do musical notes in ratios of small whole numbers sound beautiful to us humans? well, by mapping the inner ear and casting our brain as a pattern prediction engine which experiences accurate forecasts as aesthetically pleasing, we can understand better our perception of sound. we can slip into the spaces between and hear that what we experience as beautiful are simply sounds which are predictable, i.e. those whose frequencies are in ratios of small whole numbers. spiritual science of course – for the ancient greeks – science and spirituality were not separate fields of study. e. o. wilson calls this the \"ionian dream\" in his wonderful book \"consilience\" - which is also well worth reading. in truth, every one of the greatest scientific minds since pythagoras has entertained this same unificatory dream in some manner, and all of them - without fail - have pointed to some greater pattern behind what their work itself reveals. newton is perhaps the best example: he was a deeply devout man, and yet his devotion was not the result of magical thinking: it was a consequence of the method of analysis and synthesis that he put forward most eloquently in principia. it’s worth repeating for emphasis: his devotion was not the result of his spirituality and, like, what he wanted to manifest; it was a consequence of his scientific view of the world. through some of the most visionary, critical, and rational thinking ever conducted, newton was brought to deeper insights about the nature of both himself, and the world of which he was a part. > “i do not know what i may appear to the world, but to myself i seem to have been only a like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.” > “for so far as we can know by natural philosophy what is the first cause; what power he has over us, and what benefits we receive from him, so far our duty toward him, as well as that toward one another, will appear to us by the light of nature. and no doubt, if the worship of false gods had not blinded the heathen, their moral philosophy would have gone farther than to the four cardinal virtues; and instead of teaching the transmigration of souls, and to worship the sun and moon, and dead heroes, they would have taught us to worship our true author and benefactor, as their ancestors did under the government of noah and his sons before they corrupted themselves.” newton was not, as so many pop-science writers would have you believe in a lazy turn of phrase, “brought to the edge of rationality” and therefore forced into a faith-based leap into the unknown. he was shown that there is no end to rational thought; no possibility of ever actually reaching the boundary between this and oneness. it is a vital distinction: his is a faith built on the wonder of endless permutations of what is, not a faith built on some supposed bound to rational enquiry and its demand that we believe in the inexplicable. the same goes for plato, euclid, galileo, copernicus, leibniz, kepler, maxwell, faraday, einstein, bohr, pauli, schrodinger, heisenberg, noether, jeans, sagan, feynman, levin and countless other scientists who are, at heart, some of the deepest and most sincere “believers” in history. the work will teach you how to do it kepler in his younger days, imagining the revolution of planets to be ruled by the spacing between five platonic solids, once wrote: > “god himself was too kind to remain idle, and began to play the game of signatures, signing his likeness into the world; therefore i chance to think that all nature and the graceful sky are symbolized in the art of geometry.” of course, the work taught him that his model was wrong; the planets revolve along more complicated ellipses. however, for staying true to observation, lady science granted him three laws of planetary motion on top of which newton would later stand, held still to the ground by the kindness of gravity. kepler knew that god was still playing the game of signatures; it was just that the tune was signed far deeper than he had ever dreamed (though that did not make his sky any less graceful, his art any less geometric). most interestingly, the ideal world of platonic solids played a big role in the development of kepler’s very real laws. this would have no doubt pleased plato, because the primary search for beauty was pretty much his ding an sig. he argued that there was a realm of ideas (or ideals), which was eternal and unchanging and provided the source of all we can name. though limiting, it is also the source of our liberation. in a dialogue between socrates and glaucon in the republic where they talk about the cave, he has socrates describe liberation as an active process of learning and engagement so as to live in awareness of the ideal behind the real. science, looked at through this historical lense, can best be described as the incremental (con)fusion – based on observation – of the real with the ideal. wilczek sums it up well: > “along the inward path, we examine our concepts critically, and try to strip them of the dross of mere appearance, to reach their ideal (i.e. ideal) meaning. this is the path of philosophy and metaphysics. >along the outward path, we engage appearances critically, and try to strip them of complications, to find their hidden essence. this is the way of science and physics [and the] outward path does in fact lead to liberation.” critically acclaimed what consecrates itself as common to liberation through either concepts or appearances is a critical approach. however, the kind of criticism used to engage concepts is what we call constructive, in that the meaning such criticism attempts to reveal is always-already a human affair. criticism which engages appearance is called deconstructive, because it attempts to reduce down the whole event, via analysis and synthesis, so as to find its “hidden essence”. paradoxically, it’s the deconstructionists who can impact the real world reliably. observing appearances, trying to measure what causes them, and reasoning about the general laws which govern such behaviour leads as surely to technological development as it did to kepler’s or newton’s reductionist wonder. on that note, “reductionist” has unfortunately become a dirty word, which seems unfair. reducing complexity into simpler parts is an incredibly powerful way to think which made its appearance long after myth or narrative in the evolutionary development of human mind. we should not be so quick to discard it. after discussing the art of perspective drawing, its links to geometry, the discovery of vanishing points on the horizon, and the way such concepts enrich our experience of the real, as well as our ability to describe it, wilczek said: > “when i am alert to these things, my experience is fuller and more vivid. i hope you will find this happens for you too. through disciplined imagination we transcend the cave of ignorant sensation.” stumbling further out the cave with the hard-won ability to render, and therefore think critically about, different perspectives led inexorably to two very important questions: what does the same picture look like seen from other angles; and what remains the same no matter which perspective you adopt? imagining real symmetries both questions have fundamentally to do with symmetry, what wilczek described that cold night in oxford as “change without change.” we know, for instance, that the laws of motion do not change whether you are standing still, or moving at a constant speed. this is called galilean translation symmetry and lies at the heart of einstein’s special relativity. of course, einstein was not the first to make use of symmetries to discipline his imagination so that it might produce something which accurately describes the real. maxwell’s equations for light display some of the most profound symmetry anywhere in mathematics, and the pattern they uncover has become the basis for describing both the strong and weak nuclear forces, too. the really beautiful thing about change without change when we can capture it mathematically was perhaps summed up best by heinrich hertz (in a tribute to maxwell): > “one cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.” you see, maxwell’s equations describe far more than just visible light. i’m not sure how often you think of it this way, but they reveal how, to wilczek’s mind, > “radio waves are just ‘light’ with a much longer wavelength, and lower frequency, than visible light. in other words, in radio waves the oscillations between electric and magnetic fields take place more gradually in space, and more slowly in time. going from radio toward shorter wavelengths, we meet microwaves, infrared, the visible, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. each of these many forms of ‘light’ has evolved from a purely theoretical construction – in other words, a dream – into a fountain of modern technology. they’re all in maxwell’s equations.” maxwell showed the almost omnipotent power of thinking not just in terms of perspective, but also in terms of a conscious search for symmetry. plato, again, would have been proud. in fact, wilczek – at a half-whisper – continued, “we have learned to work from symmetry toward truth. instead of using experiments to infer equations, and then finding (to our delight and astonishment) that the equations have a lot of symmetry, we propose equations with enormous symmetry and then check to see whether nature uses them. it has been an amazingly successful strategy.” god’s aesthetics it is only here, with a deep and critical understanding of symmetry that we can blur the line between theoretical construction and dream to catch a glimpse of what unifies seeming opposites; for what changes without change. only now can we begin to speak of some kind of unified vision for both science and spirituality. but, as always, to speak of it would be to ruin it (because my sentences lack deep symmetry). fittingly, wilczek noted instead that the “themes of connection, symmetry, and light come together in the art of the mandala”, providing this digitally-generated image as proof: birth of the son of god by r. gopakumar we must, before turning to the next big developments in critical thought, let maxwell himself have his say: > “happy is the man who can recognize in the work of to-day a connected portion of the work of life and an embodiment of the work of eternity. the foundations of his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of infinity. he strenuously works out his daily enterprises because the present is given him for a possession. > thus ought man to be an impersonation of the divine process of nature, and to show forth the union of the infinite with the finite, not slighting his temporal existence, remembering that in it only is individual action possible, nor yet shutting out from his view that which is eternal, knowing that time is a mystery which man cannot endure to contemplate until eternal truth enlightens it.” back to the quantum future after a long sip of water and some considered silence, wilczek set out into the quantum surf, which seems at first to herald the new age, before crashing into a kind of chaotic beauty beyond what your average famous guru can comfortably contemplate. basically, the core idea in the quantum world is that everything can be described by its wave function. this sounds cool, but there are three major points to be aware of: 1. working with wave functions yields probabilities, not definite answers. 2. you don’t get access to the wave function itself, only a peek at processed versions of it. 3. answering different questions may require processing the wave function in different, and mutually exclusive, ways. these, in turn, raise conceptual issues. the first raises the issue of determinism: is calculating probabilities really the best we can do? the second raises the issue of many worlds: what does the full wave function describe when we’re not peeking; a gigantic expansion of reality, or is it just a mind tool, no more real than a dream? the third raises the issue of complementarity: which turns out to be both a feature of physical reality and a lesson in wisdom. the complementarity principle holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously, and was first described by niels bohr. bohr had also done a bunch of work on the “stationary states” of atoms based on their absorption and emission spectra (back to light and connectivity), summing it up neatly with the idea that there was something of the “highest musicality” in how it all fit together. this is more than a nice way of speaking, because it turns out that the schrodinger wave equation for an electron in an atom looks very similar to the equation for vibrations in a musical instrument first mentioned in relation to pythagoras, the length and tension of strings, and the notion that all things are number. natural vibrations in musical instruments produce pleasing sounds; natural vibrations in an electron’s wave function also turn out to mean something simple and appealing for its probability cloud – it doesn’t change at all. such solutions have the properties bohr anticipated in his “stationary states”: the electron will persist in any of these patterns indefinitely, and no other patterns have that property. “static states” of a single-electron system, i.e. hydrogen harmonic patterns formed using different frequencies on a soundboard. they share deep similarities because the equations governing them have the same pattern or shape. of course, as with everything in the quantum world, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. not only do the building blocks of our universe consist of probabilities with a tendency to travel in ways which match the harmonies of musical instruments; those building blocks exist in vast numbers of identical copies, which neither evolve nor erode, nor, in a stable environment, display any properties that change in time. looking back in history, thanks to the finite speed of light, we may see, through their spectra, that the atoms in galaxies a long time ago, and far far away, behave in the same way as the atoms we see on earth today. if atoms are so stable and resistant to change, how did they arise in the first place? a lot of the above section is paraphrased from wilczek’s actual book, but remains as is for the “sake of rhythm”. a paradise within thee, happier farr of course, maxwell was alert to this conundrum, but only saw it as more evidence of benevolent creation: > “natural causes, as we know, are at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. but though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins, the molecules out of which these systems are built – the foundation stones of the material universe – remain unbroken and unworn. > they continue to this day as they were created – perfect in number and measure and weight, and from the ineffaceable characters impressed on them we may learn that those aspirations after accuracy in measurement, truth in statement, and justice in action, which we reckon among our noblest attributes as men, are ours because they are essential constituents of the image of him who in the beginning created, not only heaven and earth, but the materials of which heaven and earth consist.” so, we end up in this weird situation where quantum mechanics brings discreteness and fixed, harmonic patterns into the description of continuous objects that obey dynamical equations. though it’s not obvious, these equations, which could not themselves impose structure, can still do so through focussing the power of other principles. that is, we can discipline our imaginations with the twin constraining powers of quantum mechanics and cosmology – using cosmology to explain the poverty of energy which ‘encourages’ atoms to seek stable states, and quantum mechanics to show how poverty of energy imposes structure. the challenge, of course, is to describe this all meaningfully to you, and after discussing the additional dimensions which would be required to draw the quantum state of an atom with two electrons (i.e. helium), wilczek noted that: > “worthy images of atoms will share, in their mixture of regularity and variation, the qualities of mandalas. they will offer, too, an awe-inspiring perspective on the assertion at the heart of mystical spirituality: that art thou. because, you know, it is.” beauty at the core john wheeler once summed up einstein’s general relativity in the pithy couplet: > matter tells space-time how to curve. > space-time tells matter how to move. this turned out to be a little too poetic, though. criticizing the term “standard model” for its connotations and opting instead for core theory, wilczek is worth quoting at length on this one. > “in the full core theory, including all four forces, matter has four kinds of properties: energy-momentum, electric charge, weak charge, and strong charge. particles of matter propagate through a more complex space than wheeler allowed for, which includes electromagnetic, weak, and strong property spaces atop ordinary space. but matter follows, according to the core, the same yin principle, adapted to this more complex environment: keep going as straight as you can! > […] the wonder of the core is that all forces sound like recognizable variations of the same theme. it does not seem to me overly fanciful, and it is certainly pretty, to see in the duality matter || space-time > … an instance of the chinese complementarity yin || yang” the whole thing is self-similar across scales, and in all dimensions. this is what makes valid the claim that the weak and strong forces are based on the same exact pattern as maxwell described for electromagnetic forces; it’s just that they include extra property spaces, like spin and colour in addition to the charge we find in maxwell’s dreams. though gravity presents something of a problem, all four can be neatly captured: > “and so, putting it all together: energy-momentum tells space-time how to curve. space-time tells energy-momentum what straight is (in space-time). > and now comes the core theory of electromagnetism: electric charge tells electromagnetic property space how to curve. electromagnetic property space tells electric charge what straight is (in electromagnetic property space) > and of the weak force: weak charge tells weak property space how to curve. weak property space tells weak charge what straight is (in weak property space) > and of the strong force: strong charge tells strong property space how to curve. strong property space tells strong charge what straight is (in strong property space) > the soul of the core, from this perspective, is yin-yang, four times over. take another moment to reflect on this simply beautiful complexity. wilczek continues to come back to this phrase “what straight is”. doesn’t that sound just like a synonym for the middle way? covariance and collisions it’s getting late, and frank’s talk is showing no signs of slowing up, but stick with me here. this is where it really counts. if we cast the four laws as we have above, we are met with a very concrete challenge, namely: how do we get equations for the curvatures of space-time and property spaces? wilczek is getting increasingly animated about the idea, slipping into hyperbole to see if anyone is still awake: > “einstein struggled with this challenge for a full ten years, calling it ‘years of anxious searching in the dark’. he achieved enlightenment by discovering suitable equations for the curvature of space-time, which completed his new theory of gravity, general relativity. he discovered them by demanding that they embody what he called general covariance, which is the space-time version of local symmetry.” with galilean translations, whether moving or still, the relative distances do not change, and so the forces remain constant. but if these relative distances change, what happens to the forces? enter the idea of local symmetries; transformations that vary in both space and time. these are achieved by choosing transformations which only apply to parts of the whole universe, and require a kind of intellectual yoga: > “this is the yoga of local symmetry – if we have a metric fluid, and we make appropriate adjustments in the metric fluid at the same time we make the motions, then we can keep the relative distances, and force laws, intact! > […] in this way, we recognise that many different images can represent the same object. but we can get more complex images, still using the same underlying object, if we allow for the presence of a distorting media – curved mirrors, says, or lenses and prisms . . . or, in general, structure that varies from place to place, and bends light. by allowing for the presence of media, we come to regard a much wider range of images as representing the same object.” (emphasis original) i know the language is technical, but just sit with me for a while in this old hall, all wood-panelled and well-portraited, and consider the immensity of that idea. marshall mcluhan may have thought the medium was the message, but he never got anywhere close to the actual maths. why electrons actually are metaphors there’s yet more to this rabbit hole, because quantum symmetries are not just about electrons, but also the “zoo” of subatomic particles which make up all our eternal atoms. unsurprisingly, the trinity of quarks which constitute part of the more popular protons, neutrons and electrons, can exist in many different states of motion, analogous to bohr’s “stationary states” and “high musicality”. over to frank again: > “these discretely different states have different energies and, therefore, different masses and so appear, operationally, as different particles! in this way, we find that many different particles reflect the same underlying material structure captured in different states of internal motion.” an electron is a proton; its internal structure is just moving in a slightly different way at the time we measure it. it is the same object seen differently through the medium of electromagnetic fluid. this shows why electrons are metaphors for a level of reality we can’t directly perceive. electrons are not like other subatomic particles: they are other subatomic particles, just in different arrangements of motion, charge, and colour when consciously measured. everything is dancing, within and without. our external movement determines what our internal concept of “life” comes to mean; the internal movement of reality determines how it appears externally at a given moment of lived observation. each dance is inextricably entwined with the other, born of the same beat, the same benevolence before which newton and maxwell and hertz and so many others bowed. three wise souls in order to understand something like strong property space and the way it curves (so important in beautiful dances), we need to assign it some coordinate system. this is called charge in quantum electrodynamics (qed), but we require another property space called colour (for no good reason) to describe the full effect of the strong force. and, unlike photons which respond to electrical charge, but are neutral themselves, colour gluons interact with one another. which is basically a bitch to work out, but leads to proof of the strong force via the grandiose-sounding asymptotic freedom of quarks – i.e. they’re super-sticky at short distances, but the force fades away over larger distances due to the way gluons interact. don’t just glide over this, because asymptotic freedom implies a certain simplicity of behaviour at high energies, which brings with it a shower of gifts. the early universe is comprehensible to us because it was such a high energy kind of party; we can read the message of high-energy collisions in labs today; and different forces come to seem less different at such energies. if that doesn’t get you interested, just imagine asymptotic freedom as the physical equivalent of the buddhist concept of the “freedom of no escape” and wander on with this meditation. describing the coming together of this theory as what is now known as quantum chromodynamics (qcd), an animated wilczek also invokes the spiritual: > “when david gross and i, and independently david politzer, discovered that it is possible, it was the sort of moment the kabbala describes as the “trembling of the veil of the temple,” when the shroud that keeps the divine world hidden from our vision stirs.” moreover, no longer is this the stirring dance of magic or mysticism, but one somehow even more filled with wonder; with the awe of patterned understanding. we move past galileo, maxwell and einstein, to find ourselves before emmy noether and the maths of time translation symmetry so that we can see how the same laws of physics that apply today applied in the past and will continue on into the future. noether, and the many other unsung women of science, bring us all the way back to ecclesiastes in one, smooth movement: > what has been is what will be, > and what has been done is what will be done > and there is nothing new under the sun. summing up wilczek, taking one last sip of water from a cup that still somehow seems mostly full, clears his throat for the final take. the central point of this whole evening has been, returning to the saint thomas quote which started it all off: caravaggio’s incredulity of saint thomas > “one sees, first, that jesus does not resist thomas’s inquisitive examination, but rather welcomes it. and one sees that thomas is fascinated and excited to discover that reality conforms to his deepest hopes. doubting thomas is a hero, a happy man […] those whose faith is not passive, but engages reality, will receive a second, more fulfilling blessing in the harmony of belief and experience. > blessed are those who believe what they see.” so, take a look at the coat of arms designed by niels bohr, and i’ll leave you with the last six complementarities wilczek bestowed upon us that night, in the hope it might lead a few wary souls somewhere closer to wisdom: 1. reduction and abundance: the basic building blocks are few and profoundly simple, defined by high symmetries. the world of objects is infinitely various and complex. 2. object and person: i am, and you are, a collection of subatomic particles. i am, and you are, a thinking person. 3. determined and free: i am, and you are, a material object, subject to the laws of physics. i am, and you are, capable of making choices, for which we are responsible. 4. transient and eternal: everything is subject to change, or flux. concepts live outside of time and, because all things are number, can liberate us from it. 5. beautiful and not beautiful: the physical world embodies beauty. the physical world is home to suffering 6. one world, and many: the existence of surrounding immensities does not subtract from me, you, or humanity as a whole. it can and does expand our imagination. niels bohr’s coat-of-arms. >“do i contradict myself? > very well, then, i contradict myself. > i am large, i contain multitudes.” > - walt whitman one story, one road now is left: that it is. and on this there are signs in plenty that, being, it is ungenerated and indestructible, whole, of one kind and unwavering, and complete. > - parmenides"

    "content": "empathy vs honesty i once wrote an essay on animal’s people by indra sinha. like all my academic work, it’s dense and philosophical and almost entirely useless. however, that book changed the way i see and hear and think about the world. it deserves so much more than academic criticism. so, it’s time to revisit what i consider to be one of the most important novels ever written. there is no way to read animal’s people as an undamaged observer: you are implicated and enmeshed at every turn in the toxicity of bhopal - the world’s largest industrial disaster. empathy, which still implies separation from suffering that is not mine, is not an ethical response. sinha’s novel requires a radical reimagining of what it means to listen to the stories of the oppressed, the disabled, and the poor - left disfigured in the wake of a liberal political system which has failed us all (though not equally). if empathy is insufficient, what is left? well, honesty about your position and place in the world, and real accountability in the face of how the world reads your personhood in this particular time and place. it is only when we own up to how we present ourselves to the world, and how the world represents us in the eyes of others, that we can meet those others as a full and fully alive human. that is, the sort of being capable of making meaning precisely because they do not deny the impossibility of truly understanding one another. the infinite distances between us, the feeling that you will never be totally understood by anyone else, is perhaps the only universally-shared experience. it is the sameness beneath all our differentiation. acknowledging that i cannot ever really understand what it is like to be disabled, to be extremely poor, or to be black is not to give up hope. it is to create the honest ground required for genuinely meaningful discussion about how we can go on living together. liberalism lacks embodiment if we can’t read empathetically, knowing that it too easily inculcates a sense of separation from suffering, what method can we use to understand stories radically different from our own? in fictions of dignity, elizabeth anker argues for “an embodied politics of reading” (9), which goes to the heart of the honesty and accountability i have outlined above. she points out that disability and embodiment might hold the key to “certain modes of aesthetic expression [which] can play a meaningful role in salvaging, as well as recalibrating, our existing social and political imaginaries” (2). this is how i read the project at the core of animal’s people: a recalibration of our social and political imaginaries. it is an immense and urgent undertaking. the narrator, animal, was disabled by the disaster, his back bent and twisted by toxic exposure so that he now moves around on all fours, viewing the world from waist-height. the story he tells is one centred around the unresolved contradiction of “what was an animal and what it meant to be human” (24). the novel is structured as a series of tapes, recorded by a foreign journalist and then transcribed directly, without any editing, into the text you read. even before describing the story, it’s very structure reveals the impossibility of really hearing the narrator or grasping his meanings without the mediation of a foreigner like yourself. animal’s interaction with the journalist begins thus: “you nodded and smiled at me. khaamush, silent then i’m” (4). the contraction to “i’m” is a recurring feature of animal’s speech. importantly, he always moves “i’m” from subject position to object position in his sentences, creating a hierarchy in which ‘you’ - the reader - naturally, grammatically, place yourself first; constantly playing the poisonous role of interpreter/editor of his odd phrasing and bawdy narration. animal is a survivor, not a hero and he - more than most - realises the extraordinary power of embodied words. he criticises farouq, pointing out that “first he does not realize that everything’s just fucking words, second this edge he misses, that when i say i’m an animal it’s not just what i look like but what i feel like” (87). this is a critical point: words may sound the same in my mouth as they do in yours, but they do not necessarily mean the same thing because of our experience in different bodies. determined to occupy his own symbolic order, animal asserts the abject nature of his narrative over and over in the first tapes, claiming that “[s]ame way is this, a story sung by an ulcer” (12). you cannot empathise with this story; you can only surrender, both to its truth, and to the fact that you cannot fully know the truth of that toxic night and its consequences in the lives of people twisted by environmental and economic circumstances out of their control. you can, however, recognise that these are the same circumstances which have placed this text in your hands now, rather than your body in bhopal then. disability voiced another effect of his poisoning is that animal hears voices. such hallucinations break down the boundaries between dream and reality; a process which mirrors - at an aesthetic level - the formal convention of using oral tapes, which collapses the borders between subject and object, reader and listener, sight and sound. “what are these voices, no good asking me” animal says, “once i was looking at nisha, this voice says, the hair pours off her hair like history. what the fuck does that mean? i don’t know” (8). these disabling voices do not present knowledge in a way you can understand, but they do enable animal to gain unique insight: “like rejoicing, the world’s unspoken languages are rushing into my head. unusual meanings are making themselves known to me. secrets are shouting themselves into my ear, seems there’s nothing i cannot know. ssspsss, haaarrr, khekhekhe, mmms, this is how the voices are” (11). animal’s subjugated body becomes, in this strange way, the site of all ‘the world’s unspoken languages’. again, you the reader need not understand this, indeed you cannot understand it. you just need to listen closely enough to hear the rejoicing which is inseparable from his unique suffering. the fact that you cannot contextualise or categorise the unspoken does not mean that it doesn’t exist, and holding the space for such possibility without forcing it into your own interpretive framework is exactly the sort of social and political reimagination the novel is trying to inculcate. an unsolvable oscillation between pain and possibility define animal’s narration, moving between the “wild, stupid, unforgivable hope” (141) that he might be comprehended and his ever-present awareness that > “you were like all the others, come to suck our stories from us, so strangers in far off countries can marvel there’s so much pain in the world. like vultures you are jarnaliss [...] you have turned us khaufpuris into storytellers, but always of the same story. ous raat, cette nuit, that night, that fucking night” (5). the “kakadu jarnalis” talks of “rights, law, justice”, but animal is quick to point out that those “words sound the same in my mouth as in yours but they don’t mean the same [...] on that night it was poison, now it’s words that are choking us” (3). you are part of the system which consumes as entertainment pain caused by its own economic and environmental operations. any reader who interprets the text using their own words (which all readers must do), necessarily poisons and stunts animal’s story in the same way that union carbide poisoned thousands of people and then essentially left them to die. “our construction of the normal world is based on a radical repression of disability” explains davis, pointing out that “the problem is the way that normalcy is constructed to create the ‘problem’ of the disabled person” (disabilities, 22-4). “what is that hush?” animal asks, sensing hesitancy, “on your side it’s shame because you know you are paying shit for something priceless.” (animal’s people, 10). vulture capitalism and toxicity i told you upfront that there is no escape from our own entanglement in each and every human suffering. it is only by acknowledging this simple truth that we can begin to reimagine both our own responsibilities, and our collective sociopolitical system. we cannot imagine our way out of the evils of extractive capitalism using tools built by capitalists. a world imagined not in terms of rights, but rather responsibilities; in terms of embodied honesty and accountability rather than abstracted empathy, is the great gift real stories truly told can give us. but facing this truth will be toxic to your current image of yourself and your place in the world. it is a toxicity which leaks into the very seams of sinha’s narrative: an old and disfigured woman asks the kampani lawyer outside court, in hindi, “you were making poisons to kill insects, but you killed us instead [...] was there ever much difference, to you? (306). the lawyer asks for a translation, which gets given as “she is asking for money”, and he proceeds to give her five-hundred rupees. the irony that we ourselves are reading a translation we also paid a pittance for should be obvious, as should the dangerous ease with which translations can be misinterpreted. this takes us back to the root of the whole work: “what was an animal and what it meant to be human” (24). animal rejects personhood as defined in our current sociopolitical imaginary because, as he points out; “if i agree to be a human being, i’ll also have to agree that i’m wrong-shaped and abnormal. but let me be a quatre pattes animal, four-footed and free, then i am whole, my own proper shape” (208). this ‘proper shape’ is the same as the ‘unspoken languages’ he has access to by virtue of existing outside what you define as ‘human’. the challenge to you as a reader is to let him keep that shape without jumping to your own easy interpretations and thereby distorting his own proper shape. embodied reading is about facing the un-translatable as it is. it’s about honestly seeing the toxic spectacle of our broken economic environment and how it disfigures any notion of “human being”. importantly, embodied reading does not use accountability to reinterpret “human being” and make us all comfortable again; it is about questioning how the category itself gets formed. who ‘wins’ the argument about animal’s status as a human being is irrelevant: “if one makes the conceptual leap to label oneself disabled [...] then the leap is the issue, rather than the qualifications for the leap” (disabilities, 2). this is why animal’s response is consistently obstructionist and objectionable (and must remain so in any ethical, embodied reading). sinha’s objective, like davis, is to “confound the question and, by extension, the category the question begs” (xvi). it is abundantly clear that empathy is not a robust enough moral foundation from which to understand being-in-a-body. animal does not want your pity; “i refuse to be a fucking bhondsi-ka victim” (27). naming words how can one read a story dictated in a different language by someone who refuses to submit to your modes of understanding, and who will not be pitied? well, we can begin with what they choose to call themselves. jaanvar literally means animal, though nisha (whom animal loves) tells him that “jaan means ‘life’. jaanvar means ‘one who lives’” (35). the name is undeniably toxic, but animal’s reclamation of the life-affirming qualities of his identity, through love and on his own terms, points to a productive tension in toxicity. his name and stature give him the ability to operate free from the constrictions of ‘human’ perception; an ability to survive outside the norms and liberal values of human rights discourse. davis argues that “when we start conceiving of disability as a descriptive term and not as an absolute category, then we can begin to think in theoretical and political ways” (disability, 8) which, “in thinking of disability [...] consider the disability of thinking”. names are words which carry overt meaning and yet, even here, embodied reading requires that we recognise how disabling our own thoughts can be when we refuse to go beyond the surface of quick and easy translations. when we are not available to listen to the full story, without judgement, we deform our own understanding. animal considers all the people who will read the journalist’s work, which he terms an “awful idea. your eyes full of eyes. [...] their curiosity feels like acid on my skin” (7). eyes can only ever reduce his embodied experience to visual, and therefore disabling, analogues which make “no sense. how can foreigners at the world’s other end, who’ve never set foot in khaufpur, decide what’s to be said about this place?” (9). his embodied, toxic story exposes reading as inherently motivated by the unequal, global power relations at play in any text. he takes elli on a tour, but decides to try and charge a fee: > ‘friends don’t charge each other for favours.’ > ‘we are friends,’ says i, ‘but not equal friends.’ > ‘crap. of course we’re equal.’ > ‘no, we’re not. you are rich and i am poor.’ > ‘what has that to do with friendship?’ \\[...\\] > > ‘you said our friendship was not equal, well i am giving you something, you can give me something, each of us gives freely, not because we have to, but because we want to. this makes us equal.’ > ‘elli, this equality leaves me broke.’ (175-6) of course to elli, the philanthropic american doctor, everyone should be seen as equal before the law and no-one should be discriminated against. animal does not deny this, but rather his deformed body asserts its own framework in which equality has less to do with so-called human dignity and more to do with economic power and the abstracted, extractive, normalised systems on which it is based. seeing sound our sense of “normal” is constructed first and foremost through sight. davis points out that “disability exists in the realm of the senses [...] yet, paradoxically, it is through the senses that disability is perceived” (disabilities, 12). when a person enters our field of vision and we see them as ‘disabled’, we are ourselves disabled by that perception. similarly, the structure of animal’s people forces honest readers to acknowledge their inability to hear animal’s truth: we are literally looking at text transcribed and translated from oral tape recordings. there is a deeper poisoning at work, for “words are grounded in oral speech, writing tyrannically locks them into a visual field” (walter ong, orality and literacy, 12). ong argues that sight is adapted to diffuse reflections of light off a surface and so is therefore only able to perceive the exteriority of objects - even within a room, we can only see the walls. we have to open a box to see inside, whereas we can tap lightly on it to determine its contents: “only hearing can register interiority without violating it” (71). sound is unifying and immersive, in that it arises from an interior structure - the voice - which resonates within the organism itself; in other words, it is a phenomenon produced and understood only through embodiment. “sight isolates, sound incorporates” (72) which means the visual ideals are distinctness and clarity, while the auditory ideal is harmony. he argues that our “complacency to think of the word as a sign is due to the tendency [...] to reduce all sensation and indeed all human experience to visual analogues” (76). sinha’s use of tapes can be seen as an attempt to highlight this danger; and an attempt to insert historical and environmental context - and animal’s body - into the centre of his work without necessarily violating the narrator’s interiority. if there were any way animal’s narrative could be understood in the incorporated world it acts against at every turn, or even vaguely comprehended - as one would only be able to guess at a box’s contents by knocking - it is through the immersive and unifying nature of sound. animal addresses the eyes directly - a paradox indicative of the toxic, yet productive, tension inherent in all his narration: “my job is to talk,” he asserts, “yours is to listen. so now listen” (13-4). he claims some agency, demarcating a specifically auditory (immersive) space in which, though inevitably determined by inequality and his abject status, he can exercise control over how sincere his words sound. in a sense, animal’s unique style, his bending and twisting of ‘inglis’ and french can be seen as his attempt to express his own deviation on sa, the eternal note. the question of sincerity highlights the difference between listening and looking, a difference animal picks up on at the start of tape three: “i keep forgetting you do not hear me [...] for you, they’re just words written on a page. never can you hear my voice, nor can i know what pictures you see” (21). if we read the whole text - particularly the present tense narration of tape twenty-two - as an extended oral performance, of which all that really exists “is the potential in certain human beings to tell it” (orality and literacy, 11); then the differences, and intersections, between looking and listening become clear: > oral cultures produce powerful and beautiful verbal performances of high artistic and human worth, which are no longer even possible once writing has taken over the psyche. nevertheless, without writing, human consciousness cannot achieve its fuller potentials, cannot produce other beautiful and powerful creations [...] we have to die to continue living. (15) the sense of performance encourages an embodied reading which allows for “silence [to] speak” (47) in the gaps created by translation and transcription, in the same way that pause and the odd laugh modulate tension in oral narratives. in fact, it is silence which “makes sound into song” (47). pandit somraj - the source of wisdom about music, notes and measures - tells animal that “if you know how to listen, you can hear music in everything” (49). just listen, and be silent. do not imagine this will let you escape from the toxic environment we have all inherited, for listening is active, and silence is just a specific kind of embodied presence. do you see yet that listen and silent are anagrams? dreaming reality in the ‘editor’s note’ which explains the tapes, there are also “several minutes of sustained and inexplicable laughter”. despite all the toxicity, humour still plays a central role within the text: zafar, dying from the hunger strike, says, “see? such an ironist. you have understood something worthwhile, my friend, in the end the only way to deal with tragedy is to laugh at it” (301). if you actually sit and reflect upon a time you were desperately hungry, and then extrapolate the state of mind and heart it would take to say these words as you’re literally starving, you may sense what embodied reading is actually about, as well as end up laughing at the very obvious, non-rational truth of these words. mikhail bakhtin once wrote: “he made the top and bottom change places, intentionally mixed the hierarchical levels in order to discover the core of the object’s concrete reality, to free it from its shell and to show its material bodily aspect - the real being outside all hierarchical norms and values” (rabelais and his world, 403). it is in the inversion of top and bottom, sight and sound, narrator and reader, dream and reality, which reveals truth, just as it disables what you think of as your ability to understand or comprehend such truths. these kind of non-rational inversions are most obviously described in animal’s dreams, where the toxic and transcendent converge. > “up high and early, my eye dreams the start of this khaufpuri day. i see the world and me in it. so high i’m, the earth curves away from me, the upper air’s full of brilliance. i see the world spread like a map, roads from all sides coming to the city” (133). there is a strong sense of possibility here. like each dream in the text, it is narrated in the present tense and, in moving out of himself into the eye-who-dreams, animal perhaps comes one step closer to the eyes of his imagined readers. however, as always, the text discourages easy readings - the view is from the top of the chimney that expelled deadly gases over the city; everywhere the spectre of the kampani looms. like zafar’s starving words, there is both tragedy and humour from this height. on a night out in the laxmi talkies with farouq, animal drinks enough bhang to exclaim “i spit in the mother’s milk of time, which, i suppose, passes. how can you tell?” (236). he then slips into another dream, again narrated in the present tense. the different, disfigured foetuses which make up the kampani board reveal themselves to him as “beings of such terrifying beauty that i want to fall on my face for surely they must be angels” (237). the dream world reveals an inverted and deep truth: the board of the company and the unborn babies disfigured by their negligence are collapsed into one image, revealing the unspoken damage wrought by oppressors on themselves. symbols of justice appear around each foetus and animal says: “life is stranger than stories and these little creatures in their round long-necked flasks, even they have found some purpose in the web of things” (237). this goes to the heart of being disabled by embodied reading - it has to do with a fundamental inversion of power. if done honestly, you can begin to grasp how the text is reading you as much as you’re reading it. what is really toxic: the world as it is, or our attempt to contain it within our limited interpretive frameworks? later, animal remarks: “endless the way home is [..] making familiar ways strange” (272). potential new meanings form in these inverted linguistic structures and animal’s home - the abject territory we cannot know by virtue of our own repressions - is presented as ‘endless’; infinite; a landscape of moonlit dream and hallucination which exists on its own terms, with its own symbolic orders, in its own tense. we can allow for this “less damning view of the dynamism and adaptability of english as a cosmopolitan medium” argues ankhi mukherjee, because “we could see in its linguistic and conceptual borrowing and syncretism not a greedy epistemology, but a longing for unbelonging, or belonging to what said called a ‘non-coercive human community’ (world, 247)” (classic, 146). although the possibility of a ‘non-coercive human community’ is rejected by animal’s final words - “tomorrow there will be more of us” (366) - his ‘longing for unbelonging’ is perhaps another indication of how we can begin to recalibrate our sociopolitical systems. love the musical nothing the breakdown of language - so central to both embodiment and humour - finds its analogue not visually, but in the multiplicity of musical sounds. animal’s unique point-of-view and ability to listen (49) means that he is the only character who, from early on, understands that on “both sides of the road it’s the same complaint” (168). only later does somraj acknowledge that “there was a certain beauty in the clashing of our musics” (198), going on to explain that “i try to hear it all together, all at once. when songs clash, as you called it, sometimes out of that comes a new music, something completely fresh” (216). written on the pir gate at the entrance to khaufpur are the words “procul hinc abeste profani”, which abdul saliq translates as: > “you are entering the city of the elect, whereof the mystery is shouted from the rooftop, but none may decipher it, yea, except within their own souls” (118). it is not precise, which - again - shows up the slippery nature of translation, but saliq’s message applies well to all the imagined eyes. it is only in confrontation with the power relations at work within the self, which inevitably bend and twist the way we read - rather than listen to - animal’s narrative, that we can begin to grasp the first strains of a new sort of music floating over the rooftops of a poisoned city. this is not to aestheticize the local realities of khaufpur, for the ideal of this music is not ‘harmony’, but “promises made by auto-rickshaws and blacksmiths, bees, rain and railway engines [...] maybe there’s even some kind of music to be had from potatoes and vultures” (250). it is a music driven by love and powered by nothing. as zafar explains, “you can fight without hope if the heart finds strength in something stronger” (75). repeated throughout the book by various characters, the power of nothing becomes most obviously embodied by the khã-in-the-jar. just as animal exists on the border of a real tragedy and a textual reimagining, so the khã exists on the border between animal’s textual reality and his dreams: “now i’m confused. this little bugger is real, i can tap the glass jar and he’ll curse me, but is he also real in my dreams? if so, what are we to make of this world that seems so solid? is it too nil but lights and dancing shadows?” (138). the khã responds: > i am the egg of nature, which ignorant and arrogant men have spoiled. i can be a friend to humans, especially the poor, for money doesn’t interest me. your khaufpuri politician [...] people like him should fear me, i’m a fire that will burn up his five senses. as for you, poor fuckwit, you think you’re an animal, i am your mother and father, i was you in your childhood, i’ll be you when you’re old. dead am i who never lived, wasn’t buried, waits to burn. (139) the egg is the ultimate symbol of nothing, as well as of nothing’s power to transform into new life. it is the fire of the five senses, thereby defying even disability. it is multiplicity-in-singularity; a single object, shaped like a zero, whose primary function is to become. it is the zone at the very beginning of creation, the site of first inception and here, in the grotesque spectre of a two-headed foetus, it serves as the embalmed, eternal symbol of embodiment. after his dream-confrontation with the whole kampani board, animal wakes up in bed with anjali and proceeds to study her vagina: > this is it, the most powerful thing in the world because all men go crazy for it [...] what is this thing? it feels wrong to call it a thing, from nowhere the word grace jumps into my head [...] i try to imagine the womb and realise that it’s an empty space, which means there’s nothingness at the very source of creation [...] for it contains the whole world plus heaven and hell beside, in its depths is the whole of the past plus all that will be. (243-4) again, nothingness is presented as the very source of creation, whether womb or egg. moreover, this passage, though explicit, is directly at odds with the rest of animal’s bawdy narration. his description contains no swear words, he calls himself “i” and places the pronoun in the subject position. his words call up the originary ground of all our becoming, and the timeless nature of being. here, for a moment we have not a thing, but empty space: a force which “makes nuclear bombs look like firecrackers” (244). little wonder that the first word which jumps into his head during this honest witnessing of an embodied reality he cannot understand due to its innate difference from his own is ‘grace’. die before you die narrating his own death, animal says “under my four feet as i walk the earth comes into being” (348). he goes on: > what am i but a complete miniature universe stumbling around inside this larger one, little does this tree realise that the small thing bumbling at its roots, scraping at its bark, clawing a way into the branches, is a fully fledged cosmos. > i, the universe that was once called animal, sit in the tree and survey the moonlit jungles of my kingdom. (350) he is the dead survivor who breaks your boundaries, whose name calls up toxic life and whose narrative is motivated by zafar’s words: “while we have life, we have the world” (284). towards the end of tape twenty-one, he explains that the “thing i am fleeing is more deadly than any of these and fouler than that poor creature rotting in his chemical womb. i am running from myself” (337) and the last words on the tape are “o lord how sweet it is, how tempting, is life” (340). animal really dies in tape twenty-two (narrated in the present tense like his earlier dreams), setting light to the factory and the khã and taking a handful of datura pills, by which his anthem is repeated: > thou art an animal fierce and free > in all the world is none like thee > in fire’s forge thy back did bend > my bitter fire be thy end (342) fire is continually associated with ‘that night’ and its toxic afterlife; but here, it also springs from animal’s own decision to take the pills, underlined by the possessive pronoun at the start of the fourth line. it is significant that the address to ‘thou’ makes it feel animal has joined you watching his own deformed shape twist and bend in fire’s forge. the present tense narration collapses perspective and so is the closest you get to an unmediated experience of his narrative. he explains > a tear drips from the moon’s eye and lands on a branch. lines of light spread in all directions, racing from tree to tree, till all the trees of the forest have silver edges, their voices are nothing i’ve ever heard, like deep flutes filled with water. ‘show the animal, show him what he really is’” (342) the moonlit tear reflected through the forest is - to me - the silver, auditory edge defining the absolute breakdown of language beyond which animal passes as the trees pick up his anthem: > you are an animal fierce and free > you shall see what you shall see > que ta chair devienne sèche > we shall feast about your flesh (345) then, instead of the many voices we have heard before, “the voice” (347) takes over. most importantly, it is the voice inside that says “whichever way you turn, this is the way [...] beyond is that other voice, which sounds deep inside, yet seems to come from outside and everywhere” (347); which is to say the voice of truth: > ‘what is a man?’ the voice roars right in my ear like a thunderclap, it flattens me. torn in pieces i’m, parts of me break off and float away. my misty thoughts go spinning and become the moon. the glare in my eye’s my eye turning into the sun, my breath’s a hot wind, riding it is a tiny god drunk with his own power whose body is covered with sores, from my middle parts come gusts of air, out of my head slides the universe. (347) just like animal watches little bits break off the khã, little bits break off him and we find described here his final coming to terms with the egg of nature that is himself and extends beyond himself to all life. as the universe slides out his head, man-in-animal or animal-in-man is presented - in answer to the voice’s question - as inherently embodied and irreducibly multiple. resurrection tape twenty-three details animal’s rebirth, starting with “that night i died \\[...\\] of death i remember nothing” (351). he still exists in a place he believes to be his everlasting home, “the deep time when there was no difference between anything separation did not exist when all things were together, one and whole before humans set themselves apart and became clever and made cities and kampanis and factories” (352). however, this is narrated in the past tense; the separation which did not exist is once again forced to by virtue of the written word. animal is found and zafar gives him an embroidered blue wedding cap. “by this gift,” animal laments, “i lost my immortality” (357). he soon returns zafar’s cap (358) and, while this does not win him immortality back, it does perhaps signify that the sense of deep time might stay with him and his imagined readers as they leave the text. a sense of life that is embodied, contextual and excessive. “animal, my brother, you are a human being, '' zafar asserts, “a full and true human being” (364). again, the novel discourages easy readings and so zafar’s claim should be read in terms of his insistence throughout that animal is a human being. however, it’s placement at the end warrants serious consideration as animal’s people concludes with one last repetition of its protagonist’s anthem: > i am an animal fierce and free > in all the world is none like me nothing more than this, no further modifiers or justifications required. the missing two lines become indicative of the power of nothing; which can never be overcome, nor can it change the fact that tomorrow, “there will be more of us” (366). but what of love? animal imagines zafar forgiving and carrying him because, in the end, “i did it out of love” (349). it is presented as stronger than hope, but mediated always by loss. though at least 5 000 people will still be dead once you close the book and hundreds of thousands more will still be suffering; love, grown from nothing, somehow remains a possibility in animal’s people. and what more can literature offer? love is “worth nothing until tested by its own defeat” (my traitor’s heart, 409) explains another forgotten body, creina alcock. “i realized that love, even if it ends in defeat, gives you a kind of honour; but without love, you have no honour at all”. works cited anker, elizabeth. fictions of dignity : embodying human rights in world literature. ithaca: cornell university press, 2012. bakhtin, mikhail. rabelais and his world (1965). trans. helene iswolsky. bloomington: indiana university press, 1984. davis, lennard. enforcing normalcy : disability, deafness and the body. london: verso, 1995. kristeva, julia. powers of horror: an essay on abjection. 1980. trans. leon s. roudiez. new york: columbia university press, 1982. malan, rian. my traitor’s heart. london: vintage, 1990. mukherjee, ankhi. what is a classic? : postcolonial rewriting and invention of the canon. stanford: stanford university press, 2014. ong, walter. orality and literature: the technologizing of the word. london: routledge, 1982. sinha, indra. animal’s people. london: simon and schuster, 2007."

    "content": "martyr of hope - a tribute to bantu steve biko conscious struggle i have never been a fan of heroes. inspiration and the sort of motivation it takes to act in both courteous and selfless ways can only — and must always — come from within. that said, i admit to having one true hero: a man by the name of bantu steve biko. if you haven’t read the collection of this singular human’s thoughts i write what i like, i recommend stopping here and familiarising yourself with his own words, rather than my interpretation. biko lived in a different time — a time when the enemy was well-known and relatively homogeneous. he was surrounded by a community united in a common fight for universal rights and suffrage. materially and physically, the struggle he found himself in and which he came to lead with such humility and grace, was decidedly more taxing than that facing our generation. intellectually, though, the lines were far more clear cut. the enemy is no longer homogeneous — it does not have one colour or one set of laws which can easily be pointed to and vilified. it does not have men like verwoed and botha to epitomise what must be fought against, and it does not have stand-out leaders like mandela, sobukwe and biko to unite a large community in the pursuit of a common aim. ours is an inescapably grey world. this does not mean that this generation does not have anything to fight for, or that it lacks the stomach to stand up for the sort of values which have always been worth protecting: responsibility, trust, faith, and love. all it means is that the battle is now exponentially more complex. however, one need not understand fully the global set of problems we now face in order to act meaningfully. this is where biko’s philosophy comes into its own, for it was — first and foremost — a positive set of ideas based on conscious knowledge of the worth of one’s self as a human being. though our world is a complex and grey one, and though the fight for a more equitable and just life for all seems interminable and unwinnable, it is from philosophies and politics like biko’s that we can draw both inspiration and clues to what solutions for our times might look like. there is, after all, nothing new under the sun. why western liberalism sucks in an essay entitled black souls in white skins?, biko turned his forceful and direct rhetoric on the figure of the white liberal: > “that curious bunch of nonconformists who explain their participation in negative terms: that bunch of do-gooders that goes under all sorts of names — liberals, leftists, etc […] nowhere is the arrogance of the liberal ideology demonstrated so well as in their insistence that the problems of the country can only be solved by a bilateral approach involving both black and white […] the integration they talk about is artificial in that is a response to a conscious manoeuvre [by the apartheid government] rather than to the dictates of the inner soul.” i think this is an important point to note, for there are an increasing number of people who describe the problems of our modern world in precisely such negative and supposedly non-conformist ways, mistaking themselves as having unique and valuable insights. in a later essay, biko laid the blame for such arrogance and hypocrisy squarely at the feet of western culture, in which: > “a visitor to someone’s house is always met with the question ‘what can i do for you?’. this attitude to see people not as themselves but as agents for some particular function is foreign [to africans]. we are not a suspicious race. we believe in the inherent goodness of man. we enjoy man for himself. we regard our living together not as an unfortunate mishap warranting endless competition among us but as a deliberate act of god to make us a community of brothers and sisters jointly involved in the quest for composite answers to the varied problems of life.” having identified the perpetrators of the more subtle and insidious kinds of evil that average men and women are prone to give themselves over to, biko presents what he believed to be a uniquely black, african solution: > “in rejecting western values, therefore, we are rejecting those things that are not only foreign to us but that seek to destroy the most cherished of our beliefs — that the cornerstone of society is man himself — not just his welfare, not his material well-being but just man himself with all his ramifications. we reject the power-based society of the westerner that seems to be ever concerned with perfecting their technological know-how while losing out on their spiritual dimension. we believe that in the long run the special contribution to the world by africa will be in this field of human relationship. the great powers of the world may have done wonders in giving the world a military and industrial look, but the great gift still has to come from africa — giving the world a more human face.” use your heart, free your mind for thinking and speaking like this, bantu steve biko wins my undying love. his words have a physical effect on me, starting as goosebumps in my milky-white skin, surging through my stomach, and stopping in my lungs, where breath can no longer pass, so caught is it in the implications of his words. it was biko's realisation — drawn from a long history of african thought collected under the umbrella term of ‘ubuntu’ — that community was the place from which one drew both true power and comprehension which singled him out as such a brilliant and persuasive individual. it was his realisation that there is nothing more worthwhile or noble than fighting to give society a more human face, and that such a ‘fight’ will always, in fact, take on the nature of a gift given by what he termed ‘selfless revolutionaries’ that marks him forever as my only true hero. it was, indeed, biko who first argued that: > “at the heart of such [communal, human-centric] thinking is the realisation by blacks that the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.” this is true in any generation — no matter how complex the world they face. and it remains as necessary today to free your mind from both the narrow, capitalistic narrative that what you make and who you know are all that matters; as well as the equally simplistic and misleading narratives of transcendence, abundance, thriving, or whatever other buzzword you care to pick as you scroll down the omnipresent newsfeed. we live in dangerously interesting times. there are no simple choices left, but this should not prevent an honest reckoning with what biko called ‘the dictates of the inner soul’ for it is there — as it always has been — that we are most likely to stumble upon truth. finally, in a letter to a priest, biko summed up his thoughts by writing, clearly and elegantly: > “in my view the truth lies in my ability to incorporate my vertical relationship with god into my horizontal relationships with my fellow men; in my ability to pursue my ultimate purpose on earth which is to do good.” if only a few more humans in our age were gifted with such simple genius. singular love ultimately, i don’t think that living in a grey world is a terrible burden. the complexity we face is far greater than it has ever been, but this also means that the opportunities we are presented with are more varied and accessible. as for the almost-interminably interwoven and complex nature of power that we face — and to which we must always endeavour to speak our truth — i can only paraphrase the two most formative movies of my life: on romantic evenings of self i go salsa dancing with my own confusion, for a revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having. finally, biko - with mandela - is the man most representative of the political singularity that took place in south africa at the end of the 20th century. in this context, i use “singularity” to point at a being or action so extraordinary in its scope or vision that they echo throughout history and change indelibly the nature of the lives or actions that follow. simply put, biko is proof that singularities happen, and have always happened, lodged as they are in the breasts of human beings who act with the righteous might of selfless revolutionaries. bantu steve biko’s life is proof that there exists in this world a kind of love that does not make any proclamations of its worth, nor ask anything of its beloved. a kind of love that is fragile and vulnerable enough to die in the back of a police van somewhere between port elizabeth and pretoria. a kind of love strong enough to resurrect itself in the hearts and minds of people for generations unending. a kind of love that is at once unique, finite, and deeply personal, and simultaneously universal. a kind of love that is eternal. his life is proof of the ordinary nature of miracles and what i once heard called “the tender gravity of kindness” — a cosmic force powered by the simple conviction of true belief."

    "content": "blue devotion > “but there is one kind of knowledge — infinitely precious, time-resistant more than monuments, here to be passed between the generations in any way it may be: never to be used. and that is poetry.” — muriel rukeyser the blue book is alive! there is no time like the present my first book was a slim, physical thing, with intersecting railway lines on the cover, printed by some friends in east london. it was fun to publish – i got to learn about the industry, see some industrial printers at work, and generally be a part of inscribing immaterial thoughts onto the material world. to publish a book is to join a long and storied tradition of pattern-making people who try to pull from their imagination real possibilities for other ways of being. it is to become, literally, the diviner of signs as seen through the lens of ordinary life. this is not really anything big or mysterious and mystical. it is not even spiritual. it is simply the honest and sincere remembrance of what it’s like to live: > “time seemed to vanish. urgency vanished. any important difference between myself and all other things vanished. i knew that i belonged to the world, and felt comfortably my own containment in the totality. i did not feel that i understood any mystery, not at all; rather that i could be happy and feel blessed within the perplexity — the summer morning, its gentleness, the sense of the great work being done though the grass where i stood scarcely trembled. as i say, it was the most casual of moments, not mystical as the word is usually meant, for there was no vision, or anything extraordinary at all, but only a sudden awareness of the citizenry of all things within one world: leaves, dust, thrushes and finches, men and women. and yet it was a moment i have never forgotten, and upon which i have based many decisions in the years since” — mary oliver i’ve spent the last few years loafing in the greener fields of the internet, wondering about alternative forms for books, inspired by two, very different thoughts which mingle in strange ways. 1. j. r. r. tolkien wrote about the difference between applicability and allegory, claiming the first to be infinitely better. applicability opens the door to interpretation by the reader, whereas allegory lies in the “purposed domination of the author”. basically, if you’re arrogant enough to think you can come up with an allegory that adequately expresses the age you live in, you’re better off writing pulp fiction. if a book is written and read not allegorically, but with a view to how it applies to your life, then a wonderful translation has occurred and it may open the door onto what tolkien called “other time”. 2. in “gӧdel, escher, bach”, douglas hofstadter makes the point that: “before avery had established the connection between genes and dna, the physicist erwin schrödinger predicted, on purely theoretical grounds, that genetic information would have to be stored in ‘aperiodic crystals’, in his influential book what is life? in fact, books themselves are aperiodic crystals contained inside neat geometrical forms.” geb is way too dense to summarise here, but this is a crucial point. books encode, literally, some pattern of mind (or soul, or personality depending on your interests) which is timeless, and can be passed from “i” to “i” potentially forever. this pattern is stored, like dna and many other dense and self-recursive encodings of meaning, in physical form: strings of letters printed sequentially and bound between a cover. however, online media offer other ways to encode the same, timeless, pattern; ways which are potentially more expansive. ways which will take you directly to other authors, other times, other songs which sing what this one cannot. applied writing following tolkien, digital books need to be applicable to the context they’re in: which is hypertextual and constantly connected. in fact, it is – if anything – overly connected. if the art of good storytelling has to do with what you leave out, then how can anyone possibly tell a story about what the internet really is and what new zones of consciousness it might allow us to explore collaboratively? there is simply too much you have to ignore. certainly this is true in the context of a traditional book, but what happens if we take the lessons of hofstadter and tolkien, and try and come up with a form which allows for more expansive story-telling? if there were a book that was also an open-source piece of software, that anyone could download and adapt free of charge, then not only would that book exist hypertextually, linking to what it cannot say, but anyone could replicate its form (easily and for free) to tell their own story about everything to which they’re connected. if all the data stored in such repositories were to remain open source, then we could potentially train our models, our machines, and our minds in more effective ways so that we can continuously improve the worlds we inhabit and the words we use to describe them. structure and song i couldn’t find something that exactly fit this description though. there are plenty of digital book frameworks out there, but none that think clearly enough about the form i feel is necessary for such a project. my struggle with this is described in fugue ii. eventually, i just adapted a piece of software i helped write for the status documentation site, for the simple reason that it is responsive on mobile screens, and allows me to nest content in the sidebar, so that anyone can navigate around the book easily, no matter which device or perspective they look at it through. building an online book gives you an extra degree of freedom in terms of how you structure content, as there are – by virtue of the medium itself – many different ways to move around the text. the blue book is structured as one, long song with three major parts and two, accompanying (explanatory) fugues. or is it many intersecting melodies which are sometimes harmonious, sometimes discordant, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and sometimes just plain weird? you can begin and end wherever you please, whether that’s in a specific poem, with one of the video frontispieces for each canto, deep in the tangled bank i continue to build, or just scrolling through the youtube playlist which forms the literal sound-trace of the book. for extra context; “canto” is the italian word for “verse” and a fugue is a “a contrapuntal composition in which a short melody or phrase (the subject) is introduced by one part and successively taken up by others and developed by interweaving the parts.” basically, it’s a complicated piece of music that winds back on itself in all these strange ways that tend to bend your emotions and expectations in both tragic and beautiful ways. if you’re wondering about the choice of name, keep in mind that blue is the colour of devotion, and watch this video to understand the intellectual lineage i place myself in. bitcoin another surprising influence in my work is bitcoin. very simply put, through using proof of work, bitcoin is able to translate physical stuff (electricity) into digital value without the need for a government or bank to stand surety for that value. which means we can build networks between peers that allow for free speech in a much more profound sense than previously possible. this all relies on being able to prove online that you did physical work, which is much harder than it sounds and was a real breakthrough when it happened in 2009. however, if the past ten years have proved anything, it’s that just giving people the ability to speak and transact more freely does not mean that they understand how to use this new ability (money is speech, hence “put your money where your mouth is” etc.). sometimes, in this weird future we’re living in, we don’t need better technology: we need better people. bitcoin showed us the beginning of what is really possible online, the real question has now become; if you could prove anything using the internet and its vast resources of knowledge, what would it be? i chose love, because that is what most interests me. i’m not actually saying that it is possible to do anything as absurd as “prove” love, but i do think it might be beautiful to try nonetheless. and i do think that such a project might be helpful one day when we’re trying to teach machines how to love, which is likely going to be quite important to our continued survival. love i once drew a geometrical diagram for an english masters thesis, and people looked at me like i was completely crazy. so, i won’t provide a mathematical view of the blue book, nor will i claim that it has any of the properties relevant to a “real” proof. what i will say is that this is my most honest and sincere expression of love as i have found and experienced it in my short time here. it is love as it has applied to me. in my eyes, it proves love as an independent and powerful force. but only in my eyes: i do not think it is a general proof. that you must write yourself. hopefully, in expressing sincerely our own particular truths, we can – by some strangely applied grace – touch on the universal beneath and above our individual love: for in such moments can be found the ultimate service of life."

    "content": "all the colourful people the half moon is rising late at the moment. it only peaks above the horizon and casts a rippling road of yellow light over the sea an hour or two before midnight, which means the stars here on the wild coast are something to behold on clear evenings. the milky way runs across the whole sky like an old mineral line across this third rock, revealing a way to orient yourself that all our city lights have lost in the haste and hurry of modern life. life is everywhere. it settles in every tense and all the spaces in the sentences we make up. two nights ago, i took a new friend down to the beach after sunset and before n/aueema, our moon, made her late appearance. we went down to the sea to walk on sky. to wander between the stars cast perfectly in reverse on this first mirror, shining in the millimetre of silk left floating above the saturated sands as the tide retreats, as if all the waters in the world were needed somewhere else to raise the white knight, keep her circling our home, before they wash back in and herald another golden dawn. we wandered through the past, pointing out all the constellations we could remember, telling old stories about orion and sirius and andromeda and all the stars between, so thick you can barely see any background. and then we sat on the shore, the sea itself our incense, and listened to an old tibetan bowl sing of emptiness and submission and what it means to be saved by grace. in such a magical place, with myth so palpable you can feel it without reading any words, still this new friend struggled with meditation. even here, covered in the african dark, it can be difficult to empty your mind. but “the point” of meditation is not to get good at sitting around, thinking about nothing. if anything, it is to turn the living of life into a meditation: every act and thought achieved in a reflective and care-full way. just as “the point” of shamanism or sangomahood is not to learn how to hold ceremonies, but rather to turn living itself into a ceremony: every act and thought ceremonial, done with a sense of sacrifice and stepping aside to let what is sing its singular song. we might even say that “the point” of art is not to produce a masterwork, but rather to turn your own life into such a masterwork through creative attention to the kind of details others miss. this is a yoga: to turn the living of life into one, continuous piece of art made up of discrete and jewell-like moments, separate in time and space, but connected by the kind of beauty that will save our world. massaging the medium one of the most powerful media we have for achieving such a lofty aim is simply conversation. if you can listen to others deeply enough to learn how they love, which is to say to learn how they see the world the way it is and somehow agree to go on living, you can enter into a sincere dialogue where all is performance and nothing is kept secret. by asking good questions, rather than just listening to respond, and by letting the “third space” between us lead any collection of words we might utter or encounter closer to the truth as it is in that moment, we can colour our lives with all the strangest and most awesome shades. knowing the depth and wealth of colour that awaits us in the shadows is yet another kind of yoga. which leads me to two fantastic conversations i’ve had recently – one with an engineer, the other with an artist – about colourful people. it seemed, in both talks, that humanity can be roughly divided into “colourful” and “grey” people. colourful people are those you meet who seem always to have an interesting question or answer for you, who bleed light despite themselves and come to conversations armed with pebbles carved down from what were once mountains and leave them humbly at your doorstep for some time later when you’re finally ready to notice them. grey people are those you meet who seem always to have a problem, who respond only insofar as it relates to themselves and their own suffering. in the artist’s rendering, they are the “adults” of this world, so crusted up with old and narrow ways of seeing that they must be broken down again before they can realise what it’s really all about. born and made however, while i think full human being may well be an achievement we must work to reclaim after growing out of childhood, i have this sense that colour is a birthright. we find ourselves somewhere mysterious between the born and the made, and i cannot help but believe that everyone is at least born with the ability to be colourful, even if making ourselves into a human being who can respond appropriately always to our world and the others with whom we share it is something of which many fall short. moreover, the point is not really to “break others down” so that they can see again what simply is. there is, firstly, a notion of hubris in this not suited to fine art. who are you? why is your way of seeing any better than any other? secondly, looking at the world this way gets tiring quickly. if you think constantly that you are responsible for shattering the glass lens of others’ illusions, that you must always be “good” despite living in a world full of suffering, then it tends to get pretty overwhelming pretty fast. the cognitive dissonance is immense. again, who are you to be good? why should what is good to you also be good for others? > you do not have to be good. > you do not have to walk on your knees > for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. > you only have to let the soft animal of your body > love what it loves. > tell me about despair, yours, and i will tell you mine. > meanwhile the world goes on. > — mary oliver these lenses through which we look at the world – the ones which become encrusted as we move away from childhood and make ourselves, with the help of a largely harsh and indifferent world, into adults – are an inevitability. much like the self or the ego, any introspective journey will show them up as ultimately illusory and responsible for a whole bunch of distortion, but it will also eventually bring you back to realising just how important such wilful distortions of the world are for practical action: we cannot survive the immensity of the ordinary without a motivating ego. converse with care the goal of artistic conversation is not to shatter others’ lenses, nor to show up your own as somehow clearer. if anything, it is to realise through paying attention that everybody is born colourful and sometimes all we need to do is stand next to another human and help them turn their inevitable lens just the slightest bit, so that instead of letting the light pass through grey and unnoticed, we might bend by a tiny amount and reveal the whole rainbow spectrum. colour is our birthright. turning that smallest bit to reflect it, perhaps the only thing worth achieving. this is, after all, where we get the word “parable” from: translated literally as “to place beside”. though all art – including life – can only ever be a representation, by placing ourselves beside others and loving them for whatever they have learnt from their unique experience, we can turn our own being into a story which signifies something greater; something that cannot quite be got at through conventional language. then, of course, comes the near-completion of the enso that brings us back to will and representation, and how these operate as an effective means of choosing the part(s) of the spectrum which most draw your eye; how they allow you to live in your colour and make it a part of the breath your draw each new day. or you can try skipping across the whole rainbow gaily, lost in wonder that we could have forgotten – even for a moment – that there are places in this world where you can walk on stars and sing in tandem with sea and the otherwise perfect silence."

    "content": "finding blue infinity here it is, the heart in earth, breathing heavens intimately untangled. preparing the ground i've been passing time in the stream of life teaching people about giving. it's a good way to live. in the link above, i make a case for \"smart contracts as ceremonial transactional space.\" this is quite literally the word used by many people, most often when creating the correct initial conditions for their protocols: aztec and the powers of tau being just two examples. more broadly, ceremonies and ritual invoke in us a sense of the sacred, which is really just \"something more than me\". i'm not a cryptographer, though, so how can i go about creating my own little ceremonial space on these new, decentralised time machines? i thought about this as i walked down an empty beach and considered the recent boom in non-fungible tokens on ethereum. i have never combined my poetry and any \"blockchain\" technology because of this very simple insight from muriel rukeyser, which i love: > “but there is one kind of knowledge — infinitely precious, time-resistant more than monuments, here to be passed between the generations in any way it may be: never to be used. and that is poetry.” this same essential idea can be found throughout the qur'an, most prominently - because nothing is a coincidence - in surah ash-shu'ara (the poets), see 26:127, 145, 164, 180-1, but also in many other places, like 25:57-59 6:90. i will never sell a poem, because i do not write them for reward. i write them as reward. that is, the simple act of writing poetry is already reward enough for me. therefore, it never made sense to do anything on chain, as i'm just not interested in making money from poems. but, as i walked down that empty beach and thought about our last speaker in kernel block iii - britt harris - and his question \"what will you do when you have more than enough?\", i had a moment of insight. what if i could use nfts to grant responsibility for each chapter to someone i love and respect? that way, they could always change what appears in that chapter and the \"found\" versions of the blue book could extend indefinitely, limited only by the innate creative capacity of each guardian. which is the same as saying, the kinds of versions we can find together are limitless. readying the library before telling you how the ceremony unfolded, we must speak about this word \"found\". what on earth does it mean to \"find\" a book? well, it's all to do with a jorge luis borges short story and an internet friend of mine called jonathan basile. jonathan, the same man who tweeted this timeless insight, actually built the infinite library borges wrote about in “the library of babel”. there are some caveats to this, but the libraryofbabel.info is made up of all the characters in the latin alphabet, plus a space, a comma and a period. each line contains 80 characters, each page contains 40 lines, each book contains 410 pages, and books are arranged on shelves, which are grouped in volumes, which are placed against the walls of hexagons, just as borges described it in his original short story. this means that every thing it is possible to write in 3200 characters using the latin alphabet already exists in the library. one does not write something; one remembers it, puts the text into the library's seach function, and is reminded of where it already was. go and try it yourself. take that poem or diary entry or dream you once wrote and never showed anyone and try not fall out your chair when you discover it was already in there. when thinking about creative ways to engage people going through kernel, i decided to write some \"koans\": cryptic little treasure hunts through the library that were based on the content in each module. you really had to understand what was being taught each week to find your way through the whole koan and win the nft gift at the end of them. while i was doing this, i got quite excited by the effect the constraints of the medium had on my writing and began writing a bunch of other stuff, which i then put aside and promptly forgot about. sufi shaykhs feed the birds zen masters play bass to early morning country music. there is no mystery in this only life. need is just to be given away so, in humility, i come to know the unspeakable glory. the ceremony it was this \"other stuff\" which came back to me as i envisioned having nfts which could be given away to people i love that would grant them the ability to change a chapter in the fifth, final, and infinite peace of the blue book. i knew i could find all this \"other stuff\" in the library, gather all the links to each library page into one page on my site, and present it as a chapter. no problems there. the issue is: how to use nfts to manage what gets displayed on a website? and, the truth is, it turns out to be simple. 1. i used holly grimm's wonderful neurapunks nft contract - which comes with full instructions for any interested developers. 2. i adapted it to let guardians update the which stores the metadata for each nft. 3. i use this contract to mint guardian nfts and give them to people i love. 4. i set the in the metadata of those nfts to an arweave page where i have uploaded the html file. 5. i use the alchemy api and a tiny bit of jquery to fetch the metadata associated with each nft, query the and replace the html content on each chapter page with whatever comes back. it takes 6 lines of code per token to do this. 6. guardians are therefore entirely in control of what gets displayed for their chapter and can change it by using the method in the guardians.sol contract. as you can see from the links above, everything is free and open source and always will be. please take this, improve on it, and do more creative things if you feel inspired. finding blue infinity you can find the first version of this peace of the blue book here. there are many more chapters to write, and the library never ends. only love can find the shore. &nbsp;&nbsp; i broke a glass today and we spread a table together, so my bookish blood tells me this is the day i am married, for my soul mate has found me and it's all so very simple. death is the cycling of eternal life and now is timeless. thank the others always, let peaceful water flow and leave here a garden for our children, those playful phases of you and i come back to recite these lines: let there be light."

    "content": "governing gracefully > tl;dr - governance mechanisms that distribute funds by virtue of how they work will trump those that attempt to distribute funds as an outcome of their work. blockchains make it possible to fuse financial value with any speech act. when i vote on something i care about, i can simultaneously send money along with my ‘word’ of support or rejection. this represents a literal step function in how we communicate what is valuable. therefore, the idea that we should allocate “votes” to those who own governance tokens, but not require those tokens to move when being voted with is pernicious and destructive. tools like tally and snapshot, which disassemble this foundational aspect of our new media - fusing money and speech - can lead us to one place only: a hyper capitalist hellscape, where more power is concentrated in the hands of fewer people, who are less regulated. where we actually want to end up. some history i wrote the dapp curation mechanism for status. it’s very simple: the more tokens you lock in a contract, the higher you rank, with one caveat. the more you pay to rank, the cheaper it is for others to vote on your content. this means users have to pay to vote: when i upvote, the money is also locked in the contract and added to the ranking; when i downvote, the money is sent straight back to the dapp owner and subtracted from their ranking. at first blush, it may seem strange, especially since snt is a minime token, a standard designed specifically so people could vote without having to lock their tokens (a common pattern in the early days). there are two common issues people have with my design: 1. doesn’t this just give more power to those who already have resources? 2. users won’t pay for anything online: that is what web 2 has conditioned us to expect. the answer to (1) is a simple “no”. people with lots of resources already have power. the maths in the contract ensures in a transparent and verifiable way that the more power you already have, the easier it is for those without power to voice a meaningful (and measurable!) opinion on your ranked content. on a long enough timeline, this actually creates more level playing fields as a result of how and where the money in this system is programmed to flow. the answer to (2) is a bit harder: tokens represent a world of digital abundance, especially those used to govern digital goods. we are going to live in a world where there are billions of different tokens, each with a supply in the billions. again, on a long enough timeline, the thing which will make these tokens valuable is not the reputation, or even utility, of the protocol they govern today: it is the viability of their internal economy. a good proxy for this is often the velocity and momentum of money: that is, how fast money changes hands and how far it goes. funded code running consensus the ietf came up with the notion of “rough consensus and running code” for their governance process in the 1990’s. this is an elegant solution, contextually appropriate to the internet circa 1992. however, despite all its advantages, it still requires a working group chair to make decisions about whether all technical objections have been addressed or not. this simple fact makes it largely inapplicable to blockchain governance. the critical insight here is that we now have running code responsible for maintaining consensus and, moreover, this code fuses economic and political expression. we no longer require a chairperson to decide on one direction in which to work, because we can use our econo-linguistic networks to fund as many different directions as possible, simultaneously. what i am saying is radical: forget quorum, participation and all the other “nice” social outcomes people are trying to design for with ill-conceived tools that disassemble the single most interesting thing about blockchains by allowing you to vote without spending your tokens. build simple mechanisms. anyone can create a governance proposal. proposals must specify the budget they need to do meaningful work. no quorum is necessary: all that is required to begin work is enough “votes”, in the form of tokens, being sent to the project in order to fund work. that is it. be honest participation in blockchain governance at the moment is dismal, so won’t requiring people to pay when voting make this infinitely worse? yes. but participation is a lousy thing to optimize for. participation should be an outcome of any political process, not a design goal: and the difference really matters. let’s take a look at how things currently stand. project a launches a “governance” token. they specify in their launch that “token a has no economic value; it is a governance token used to oversee the project a ecosystem. it has no claim on financial rights,” even though they know full well - given previous projects like yfi and the decentralized exchange infrastructure which now exists - that it will be traded and that the market will assign an economic value to it. this brand of dishonesty not only does us all a great metaphysical disservice, it prevents the team from thinking clearly about ways the token could be used creatively. it doesn’t matter how “decentralized” your initial distribution is: what matters in the long term is how the token moves around your self-proclaimed “ecosystem” and what incentives there are to spend it. if governing the system requires people to spend their tokens, then this becomes the perfect sink and the single feature that will ensure a healthy distribution in the long term. it moderates the ecosystem in healthy ways: the token has value only insofar as it is used to fund projects which enhance the ecosystem and value accrues only as a result of the ways in which the token is spent. this approach forces early investors to spend some of their reserves, rather than just holding power over the protocol indefinitely, or pumping and dumping it at their own convenience. it also means - and this is critical - that governance is the means by which distribution of funds happens. distributing funds is not the outcome! exploring interesting and fertile directions for the development of mutually beneficial software is the outcome, governance is the means by which funds are allocated to achieve this. votes-as-costly-economic-signal also doesn’t preclude having dao treasuries and innovative helper functions like quadratic funding. in fact, it gives them a genuine raison d’etre. the dao treasury can help fund in a quadratic way those projects which stronger, economic community signals suggest are most likely to succeed. what matters here, again, is your time horizon. maybe you’ll only end up funding one project a year as a community. so what, though? when your protocol is going to affect our shared state for millenia to come, shouldn’t we be highly intentional about the kinds of things we build and the nature of the changes to our mutual history they enable? on time consider the phrase “time horizon”. the shared state we are constructing today will outlive all of us. it will outlive many, many generations to come. the actual mechanisms which process it - currently the evm - will likely change, but the state itself is going to continue for a period of time no individual living now can readily conceive. the arweave team are some of the only people i know who really get this idea: > “this pattern of ‘nesting’ of archives when they are retired is common across human history. an archive of gopherspace (a ‘knowledge web’, prior to the http-based web) can be found inside the arweave’s permaweb. inside the gopherspace archive, one can find archives of earlier telnet and bulletin board-based discussion systems. similarly, much of the library of congress is now archived on the web, and indeed many of the books contained within the library are themselves collections of old stories/poetry/technical writing. we anticipate that the post-network future of arweave’s data preservation will continue in a similar pattern, bolstered by the cryptographic interweaving of all data in the network (true verification of a part requires the presence of the whole), and the incentives in the network to create many replications of its information – most of which will never be deleted, even if the miners themselves are disconnected from the network.” (bottom of page 21) if your governance token gives special permissions to specific parties, it is likely to fail this very simple test of time. or modifiers suck, not just because of regulatory issues, but because they fundamentally fail to acknowledge and design for the dimension of time along which we are really working. more broadly, token governance is not an initial value problem. it is more like a boundary value problem, and the boundaries are the incentives people have to use, hold and, most importantly, to spend the token. mkr is a good example of a healthy token ecosystem, bounded by clear incentives to hold the token strongly coupled to the necessity of participating in governance decisions. if token holders don’t make good decisions about the parameters used to keep the system in check, it may become under-collateralized, and they will be diluted as more mkr is printed. you need both rewards and penalties to build good systems, just as it takes positive and negative feedback loops to ensure viable ecosystems. critically, the key insight of - for instance - work on eth2 is that penalties matter more. mkr need not be spent to vote, but they did write some very cool custom code for ds-chief that works by locking tokens (so there remains an opportunity cost) into slates. they are constantly improving it, and they did a tonne of research into different kinds of voting on their forum. makerdao can implement balanced rewards and penalties more seamlessly given the purely financial nature of dai. this post is about less financial protocols seeking to govern things like public goods, which cannot be so neatly parameterized on chain. the subtle knife what i am really advocating for is more subtle than dualistic penalties and rewards, though. we can design token ecosystems where what was previously a “penalty” - i.e. spending your money and therefore decreasing your financial worth - actually becomes the very act which ensures that the tokens you remain with become demonstrably valuable. the penalty is the reward when we build governance systems that distribute funds by virtue of how they work, rather than as the outcome of their work. --- feedback comments on this essay point out that it is unclear how getting token holders to spend their tokens actually redistributes power, and that this approach will effectively silence small token holders. 1. using tokens as votes does increase the supply if projects need to sell those tokens to fund their work. my sense is that this is balanced somewhat by (a) increased demand for a token with increasingly demonstrated utility and (b) the fact that projects can likely fund a lot of their work with the token itself, as contibutors have strong incentives to hold \"equity\" in the form of tokens associated with the stuff they're actually working on. 2. currently early investors often get discounted rates, investing before token sales, and then taking a chunk of tokens below market rates. forcing them to spend in order for governance to work does redistribute these tokens and - at worst - such investors have to buy them back at market rates, which certainly appears to balance things somewhat to my eye. 3. it's true that this system does not optimise for particpation, because these are not nation states, but voluntary communities. what it does optimise for is collective decision making about the \"direction of maximal interestingness\" as a function of some internal economy. another interesting adaptation could involve sending votes-as-funds directly to projects, governance tokens could be returned to the dao, which in this case acts as a kind of governance token amm. it receives tokens on projects' behalf, funds them quadratically in a stable coin if they reach their specified budget threshold, and then redistributes the governance token to new potential members. this redistribution can happen through the completion of rabbithole tasks, the funding of educational courses for interested learners, rewards for content and marketing contributions, development bounties, security audits, and any other method currently being experimented with. there is much discussion about this in the wider community, which has resulted in vitalik publishing his thoughts. personally, i think his notion about votes as buy orders is the most interesting addition to the research he has made so far. my sense is that any reputation, identity or proof-of-humanity scheme is doomed to failure because who you really are cannot be fully captured in any language; even universal, executable ones."

    "content": "language in the ether prologue “it is language that shoots up like fire – wrought from a vision of where we must go and from a grip on where we are now” — antjie krog a new friend asked me today why and how i had become interested in ethereum. in order to explain, i had to go back to the year i graduated high school, which was – coincidentally – the year bitcoin was unleashed onto the world. maths and metaphors i set out to study maths and physics because i wanted to understand the universe as completely as possible, and those two subjects seemed to offer the most precise, succinct and – frankly – beautiful symbolic language for doing so. however, gödel’s incomplete shadow lurks in later years for unsuspecting maths students, and heisenberg herds his cats with uncertainty through physics buildings late at night. i remember one lecturer with this crazy beard and the sort of kortbroek (short pants) beloved by eastern cape sheep farmers, who failed most of the class when we attempted ac theory, and then walked beaming into our introduction to quantum mechanics to tell us there was no such thing as an electron. “an electron is just a probability density wavefront moving through space” he said, gleefully. “it’s a metaphor for a kind of reality we cannot directly perceive”. i was badly hungover and had just failed his ac theory course – which is all about how electrons flow through circuits! – so it took me some time to calm down and appreciate the gravity of his words. eventually, i sobered up, grasped what he was really saying and signed up to read a masters in english literature, hoping to understand the nature of metaphor itself more deeply. i wrote about ontological frameworks and singularity in the country i grew up in and love. it was an interesting experience: using language in order to take apart the ways in which i look at the world and then put them together again so as to reveal something else, some other story, some strange but fragrant song about how truth is still, always, singular. though i sang in my chains but, our languages are also constrained. ambiguous. we cannot think in ways which transcend spacetime – which is what would be necessary to describe the phenomenon fully – because natural language encodes meaning in sound, which propagates linearly through space, and so is always-already bound to time. i was caught in incompleteness once more. however, the other side of the limited language coin is that something as far-fetched as time travel is impossible only when the concept is arrived at through conventional linguistics. arrival, the sci-fi movie, demonstrated this beautifully. the idea is simple, the result astounding: if you can encode meaning in ways independent of sound and therefore space, you can experience time itself in a radically different manner. it should be no surprise that the man who made up the alien language – which is circular and logographic – is none other than stephen wolfram, of wolfram|alpha fame. wolfram is a personal hero of mine, calls himself a language designer and has been building the wolfram language for close on ten years, but is really just the latest in a long line of people who spent their lives looking for something like ‘the perfect language’. perfect language? the list stretches all the way back to the ancient greeks and likely beyond, but the man who really got the search kick-started more recently was named gottfried leibniz. today, maths students around the world use newton’s calculus, but leibniz’s notation, because the man was obsessed with condensing the most meaning he could into the simplest symbols. he spent a lot of his time thinking about how we frame things, which sorts of ontological windows offered the most insight with the least complexity, and a bunch of other things most people never consider. there were many before leibniz, like raymond lull, all detailed by umberto eco in his book the search for the perfect language, and many after him: charles babbage; ada lovelace; alan turing; georg cantor and bertram russell; c. s. lewis and j. r. r. tolkien (and the rest of the inklings); david hilbert, c. g jung; and today, people like diana slattery and stephen wolfram. however, it was leibniz who first suggested binary as a candidate for the perfect language. there was something about the mystical nature of 0 and 1 that hooked him. don’t get me wrong – especially if you fall down the diana slattery, xenolinguistics rabbit hole – there are many other ideas (apart from plain old binary) about what a perfect language might look like floating around out there. one that i particularly like is scott alexander’s idea of raikoth. it would be awesome to live in a world like that, at least in my opinion. the art of reading however, back in the “real” world, i like binary as a working candidate. in fact, i have spent a lot of time recently building simple frameworks for ordinary people to express themselves in a language which can be read as perfect by anyone who cares to interpret them. to paraphrase vlad zamfir, the “can be read” part is in bold because it’s important, but i’ll circle back to it later. software offers us a whole new class of languages which differ from natural language in that they use executable text to carry not just thought, but actions across the world at the speed of light. moreover, they are externally verifiable and testable, and that is because – conceptually at least – programming languages are a bridge between mathematics and natural language and compile down to – surprise, surprise – binary, which computers can read. why write a novel when i can build interactive, hypertext-based works which rely explicitly (rather than implicitly) on a given reader’s actions? a little further afield, why write a poem about – for instance – wandering as lonely as a cloud, when i can build an immersive experience of just that in virtual reality, replete with believable blasts of wind? there are a few potential answers to these questions, but the larger point i want to make is that our languages have evolved to encode our myths onto silicon instead of just carbon. right now, we are imprinting the same patterns that exist in our brains – what we might be tempted to call intelligence – onto a different substrate where, it is arguable, the continued evolution of consciousness will occur most rapidly. value and meaning now, in order for any language truly to express value – that is, for a language to have any meaning – it needs more than a shared substrate. language needs a medium through which to flow. natural language uses carbon as a substrate and us – human beings, the things tom robbins once described as “a way water invented to transport itself between rivers” – as its medium. however, programming languages have only a bunch of disparate computer protocols that often don’t play nicely together as their medium. that is, until 2009. in the same way the programming languages not only carry thought, but action, across vast distances at the speed of light, bitcoin was the first network and programming language that could not only carry value, but actually transfer it across vast distances far more quickly than we have ever been able to do before. that’s awesome in and of itself, but – due to its limited scripting language – transferring value by means of sending cryptographically meaningful messages is pretty much all bitcoin can do. finally, ethereum! which brings us, at long last, to ethereum. with a much richer internal scripting language, ethereum can not only carry and transfer value, it can define it dynamically by virtue of autonomous programs running in what can be imagined as a shared, global computer. using binary as a candidate for a perfect language works well because what really matters is how our language is interpreted, i.e. how we are read by others around us. well, we have a programmable substrate – silicon – on which binary is the native tongue and we now a programmable medium – ethereum – which is both a shared, transactional history and a single, global computer capable of running linguistic programs made by humans. reading from and writing to this network are well-defined operations that allow both humans and programs to communicate more efficiently and securely. the linguistic possibilities provided by a relatively new substrate running a completely new, consensus-based, cryptographically-secured, general computational medium are endless. this is where it gets really weird, though, because so far i’ve only talked about language in a more or less human context. however, the programs on ethereum can also talk to other programs and can – because they share the same, consensus-backed computer – transact between themselves. my good friend simon de la rouviere had this to say: > “it’s doubtful that programs will develop the desire to connect for the sake of it (like we do), unless we program them to do it. however, the benefits of knowing that a computation was verifiably done is like inventing religion for programs. like the biological desire to know what’s going on in others’ minds, with verifiable computing protocols, a program will know the minds of other programs. except, unlike biology, where it is imperfect, it will know exactly the state and processing capability. there’s no longer this idea of servers of data and logic connected disparately through the network.” because blockchains fuse data and networks – i.e. everywhere there is data, there is network and everywhere there is network, there is data – and provide the results transparently to everyone, programming languages can be read by other programs and human beings in an essentially perfect way, if you take the term to indicate global consensus about the deterministic output of the program or account being read. conclusion we live in a time where it is possible to tell stories that not only carry, but transfer, real value. it is therefore incumbent upon us to think more carefully than ever before about the forms we choose for our narratives, and the means by which we encode them into the world. such stories, created in languages that compile down to binary run on a global computer, can literally alter the shared notion of history we are building together. if the thought of machines that can communicate in a language approaching the perfect, or global computers that are everywhere and nowhere and can’t be switched off, or the advent of artificial general intelligence in such a context worries you, don’t be alarmed, you’re in good company. however, it is worth noting that a system like alphago didn’t end up destroying the game (read: art form) of go by beating the world champion, lee sedol. rather, in beating him, alphago revealed a new range of artistic possibilities never before considered by humans. moreover, through ongoing collaborations with the world’s best players, alphago – and the humans behind it – has advanced the game more in a year than in the last two thousand. we are learning together whole new ways to play. we need always to find constructive ways to use the tools we discover – that is the true nature of invention. i would argue that satoshi nakamoto set in motion the discovery of a whole set of new linguistic tools that we can use to help society reimagine what is valuable and how that is expressed, those two most fundamentally human actions. furthermore, i would argue that trustless means of ensuring equitable distributions of value amongst people is – in fact – a prerequisite for a functional society that coexists with things like artificial general intelligence. it’s heady stuff, and i drank the koolaid years ago, so please forgive my inevitable blind spots. i don’t feel much different from that idealistic kid consumed by a desire to know it all, except that i no longer think in surface metaphors. now it’s something more like an old story i once heard: each thought a point of light; each containing a reflection of all the others, and themselves; each unutterably unique; each supporting the other by means of what is shared. --- i don’t want to get into the implied ethics of this, i just want to note that it is a very strong possibility, and therefore well worth thinking about. the formal term is “turing-complete”. --- appendix there are a lot of links in this paper which i doubt most people will have the time to follow, so allow me to highlight just one of them, gregory chaitin’s article on the perfect language. i suggest you read it for yourself, but it’s very long, so here are some of the key, non-technical passages for people in a rush: > “the crucial point is that knowing this language would be like having a key to universal knowledge. if you’re a theologian, it would bring you closer, very close, to god’s thoughts, which is dangerous. if you’re a magician, it would give you magical powers. if you’re a linguist, it would tell you the original, pure, uncorrupted language from which all languages descend […] > leibniz formulated a version of the search for the perfect language, which was firmly grounded in the magical, theological original idea, but which is also fit for consumption nowadays, that is, acceptable to modern ears, to contemporary scientists. this is a universal language, which he called the characteristica universalis, that was supposed to come with a crucial calculus ratiocinator. > the idea is to reduce reasoning to calculation, to computation, because the most certain thing is that 2 + 5 = 7, and what is this if not a calculation? if two people have an intellectual dispute, leibniz remarked, instead of dueling they could just sit down and say, “gentlemen, let us compute!” and get the correct answer, and find out who was right […] > [… while, gödel in 1931 – and alan turing in 1936 – showed that you can’t have a perfect language for mathematics, in turing’s work] you get another proof, a deeper proof of incompleteness, but you also get a kind of completeness. > you find a perfect language. > there is no perfect language for mathematical reasoning. gödel showed that in 1931, and turing showed it again in 1936. but what turing also showed in 1936 is that there are perfect languages, not for mathematical reasoning, but for computation, for specifying algorithms. what turing discovered in 1936 is that there’s a kind of completeness called universality and that there are universal turing machines and universal programming languages. > what universal means, what a universal programming language or a universal turing machine is, is a language in which every possible algorithm can be written. on the one hand, turing showed us in a deeper way that any language for mathematical reasoning has to be incomplete, but on the other hand, he showed us that languages for computation can be universal, which is just a synonym for completeness. there are perfect languages for computation, for writing algorithms, even though there aren’t any perfect languages for mathematical reasoning […] > algorithmic information theory (ait) goes further than turing, and picks out, from turing’s universal languages, maximally expressive programming languages […] > ait has the notion of a maximally expressive programming language in which programs are maximally compact, and deals with a very basic complexity concept, which is the size of the smallest program to calculate something. > now we have a better notion of perfection. universal programming languages are not all equally good. we concentrate on a subset, comprising the ones that enable us to write the most concise programs […] > what we’re asking is, how many yes/no decisions did god have to make to create something? — which is obviously a rather basic question to ask, if you consider that god is calculating the universe. i’m giving you a medieval perspective on these modern developments.”"

    "content": "living: the essay > “there is another reality, the genuine one, which we lose sight of. this other reality is always sending us hints which, without art, we can’t receive.\" — saul bellow i have read many books in my life, searching for this ‘other reality’ scribbled out by various authors. i sought the secret everywhere and did the most silly things in my attempt to discover a way in. until one day i stopped. sincerely singular five years ago, i wrote a very boring thesis on sincerity, singularity, and the ability we have to design the ways in which we read and write. in it, i argued that “self-conscious de-sign” gives us the chance to break with the frame of representation which binds all linguistic effort. basically, language is only a representation of a representation of the thing itself – it is always, at best, two steps removed from that which is. music is a direct representation of that which is, hence all art aspires to the condition of music. however, if you use language in a self-conscious way, where the design of what you’re saying and how you’re saying it is inherently self-reflexive, you can de-sign the self; you can shift signification from the self-who-is-speaking to some larger and shared truth. though this sounds complicated, there are historical examples. the qur’an is the best and most direct: it changed the way arabs living around the year 632 could describe and relate to their being-in-the-world, primarily through the inspired shifting of pronouns between speaker and god, i.e. self-conscious de-sign. it is a language-event – a linguistic singularity – in that it offers people the chance to encounter reality in a way previously unimaginable. the qur’an, read sincerely, is a step function in that nebulous thing we like to call consciousness. to me, the qur’an is the ultimate step function, because it is encoded in language and so is infinitely dynamic while always containing a core meaning. it really is the book of truth. however, this does not mean that there have not been other singularities. i tried to show that singularity is not some specific point (i.e. when agi surpasses human intelligence) after which nothing is the same: singularities occur regularly. the development of the printing press, for instance, was a mechanistic singularity. for the first time in modern western history, the “word of god” could be distributed widely to common people, in a language they could understand. this change in the hardware of civilisation gave people direct access to divine authority without needing the priest class to mediate. what happened in south africa in 1994, when the oppressed collectively decided to forgive their oppressors – rather than following the route taken in rwanda that same year – was a political singularity, led by a few great men and women who came out of prison with their ability to love somehow enhanced, and based on a shared philosophy we call ubuntu. it allowed us to encounter otherness, and live with it, in ways we’re still trying to figure out. it is the reason i can write this today. the appearance of bitcoin in 2009 represents a technological and financial singularity. it created consensus in distributed communications and so gives ordinary people the ability to decide between themselves what is valuable, and how that value can move, without needing bankers or governments to mediate. in fact, given that it has to do not with the vertical relationship of humanity to divinity, but with horizontal relationships between human beings – i.e. it is transactional, rather than mythological – it is set to have a bigger historical impact in this world than purely linguistic singularities. it is both a network and a language, both hardware and software, and we are only beginning to see the impact of executable language run on shared and ownerless public infrastructure; ethereum being the current leader. a grand design let's take a step back: singularity is one thing, but truth and design must still be defined. these terms played into my obsession with the opening line of rian malan’s “my traitor’s heart”. it reads: > “i’m burned out and starving to death, so i’m just going to lay this all upon you and trust that you’re a visionary reader, because the grand design, such as it is, is going to be hard for you to see.” wow. what is this ‘grand design’? why is it so hard to see? why does it require a visionary reader? i kept asking these questions as i read more and dived deeper into the knots of myself. reading with inner vision – with the heart’s eye – rather than academic division, requires sincerity. it is only if we take him at his word that we can recognise how malan at once acknowledges that he can never tell the truth, yet his desire to have these bitter words heard as containing a truth which cannot be said is his ultimate truth. this is the grand design. this is the truth, and you can experience it. but as soon as i say it, truth disappears in the representation of a representation to which language is always limited. unless you drop cynicism for a moment and read sincerely what is being written here. salman rushdie called malan’s work “a triumphant instance of defeated love” and this – for me – is the whole thing in one phrase. we will always be defeated by this temporal and limited world. it is what we come here to learn: how to submit and let go of that which does not belong to us. it is in this act of final and utter submission that we can, by grace, find the endless love which links it all together. that is the definition of eucatastrophe. as rushdie wrote elsewhere: > “one day, perhaps, the world may taste the pickles of history. they may be too strong for some palates, their smell may be overpowering, tears may rise to eyes; i hope nevertheless that it will be possible to say of them that they possess the authentic taste of truth . . . that they are, despite everything, acts of love.” the blue book i stopped reading all these books written by others and set out to live the truth of my own existence. it is no small task to experience the utter insignificance of your short time here, and how infinitely precious you really are. here’s my truth, sincerely. sometimes i am arrogant, sometimes i am humble; sometimes i am misleading, sometimes inspired. more often than not i feel like i’m fumbling in the dark; just occasionally there is so much light i cannot see. like antjie krog, the music of this broke-open life has become utterly haunting: > “and i wonder: god. does he hear us? does he know what our hearts are yearning for? that we all just want to be human – some with more colour, some with less, but all with air and sun. and i wade into song – in a language that is not mine, in a tongue i do not know. it is fragrant inside the song, and among the keynotes of sorrow and suffering there are soft silences where we who belong to this landscape, all of us, can come to rest. > > sometimes the times we live in overflow with light.” having stopped reading such books, in a twist of irony – perhaps as a result of the romantic evenings of self when i go salsa dancing with my own confusion – i turned around and built one. the blue book is proof of the love i have experienced, as honestly and directly as i could express it. it is the defeated love of language, translated into digital form. you can read it in many media. watch it expand through your browser to multiple sites of meaning as it promulgates the pattern of mind books have always carried across generations, while now also literally shifting your own search algorithms in “real time”. really living i specifically did not add any analytics to the the blue book site, so i have no idea how many people have read it. i don’t imagine the number is very high. which is expected: i did not write it for an audience. i wrote it as an act of devotion. i realise now that i also wrote it as a way of teaching myself what i really think it means to live a “good” life. though many greater minds have tried, i do not think what a “good” life means can be condensed into some pithy phrase: it is about an iterative process; a living practice. i have found that the more i write what i have experienced in the form of honest poetry, the more my experience honestly becomes poetic. we design our world, and our world acts back to de-sign us. the two are in one continuous dialogue. “waking up” is nothing other than learning how to tune in to that which is already being said between soul and self, word and wor(l)d, way and wanderer. looking back at the blue book now, i can see the obsession i had with the notion of a “grand design” and the way it could be used to construct a “proof”. i both love and laugh at the part of me that (still) believes this. the book is almost baroque in its structure. though the symphony is there if you know where to look, you really have to look and i am actually a great fan of simplicity. this is at odds with the challenge of fourteen cantos, followed by some buddhist blues, a haiku harmony, and two final fugues. “do i contradict myself? very well, i contradict myself.” so i returned to a different, but equally important question in my thesis: what is it that actually gives value to human life, simply put? this ties into my ‘professional’ work on cryptocurrencies where the question of what generates value is endlessly debated. the answer most appropriate in the context of my own practice/life was there the whole time: love, trust, faith, and responsibility. value as a means of wandering the middle way between word and wor(l)d i began again, writing poems based on my experiences and then figuring out which of these four categories to slot them into. there is a natural progression from one to the other, you see. the first and most difficult step is to love. to love genuinely everything that is presented to you and take into your heart whatever is in front of you. to love completely the world you know, as if it were yourself (which it is, in one sense). of course, this is easy to say and nearly impossible to do. which is why we require trust. in order to love whatever is presented to you, you need to trust in the pattern of experience which has placed you in any given situation, be it blissful or barbaric. you need to trust that you are where you are meant to be; not because there’s some big guy up there pulling all the strings, but simply because where you are is where you stand to learn the most about what ‘love’ actually means. once again, when in blissful, poetic situations, this is easy to do. when faced with suffering and trauma and sadness, it is nearly impossible. so we require faith. this does not mean faith in something external to us – it is faith in the sense that anthony hopkins talks about it; a deep kind of knowing that we know nothing, that what we are is insignificant and passing, yet beneath it is something unchanging and miraculous. when your trust is truly tested, it is this kind of faith that withstands the forge of experience. finally, having seen that everything emanates from one and will return to that same origin, with love as the unifying force between – and trust in the faith formed through all our experiences as that which gives us to see unity clearly – you need responsibility. the responsibility of not pushing your own truth onto others, but simply living it to its fullest and letting what overflows overflow, all the while acknowledging that it is not from you. you do not exist, after all. here is the root of true, humble responsibility. as this project progressed, i realised that the poems were, indeed, overflowing and that i needed some other categories to hold them. my thesis is five years old, and i have hopefully grown some since writing it. so, i looked at what i was experiencing as a result of waking up each day with the conscious awareness that i would try and live the highest ideals of what i had written (what had been written for me), and slowly two other categories emerged: joy and peace. joy must be handled with care. it is not ecstasy or bliss, but the song of one who knows that the whole thing – all the universe – is constantly in worship whether a specific part acknowledges it or not. it is the joy of never being able to change that, but accepting the option to sing along. the joy of adding our voice to the timeless chorus we have been given the possibility of hearing, if only we would learn to wait well enough in the wake of god’s endless silence. it is not the soaring of your heart; it is its quiet beat within the body’s boundaries; pointing always at that which is boundless. at last, peace: the gateway to true knowledge of what is. this peace passes all understanding. endlessly living the blue book presents my experience of what it is that really gives value to human life. it is, for now, “the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life” as i have known it, in my limited and flawed ways. it is my attempt to express this truth relatably, using more accessible categories and without trying to force it on anyone (it’s just a subdomain, after all). like its predecessor, it will live quietly online; in git; and on ipfs, waiting for true readers to find it and decode all its many dimensions (from the commit trail, to the time-encoding links, to the poetry itself and all its many traces). unlike its predecessor, it uses youtube’s api to pass social information in addition to time, so now you’ll find specific comments highlighted for some video traces. as someone else says: > “the comment section is where i can find people with the same vibes. love and peace to all. enjoy the life trip.” this is really just an extension of an idea central to the blue book: that i can only get close to saying what i really mean through using other’s distinct voices. if it’s not just me saying it, then such works become ours. and it is this obviously fictional our which is the lie that can hopefully reveal to you the truth of what you are, where you come from, and what we are here to do. if we really do come from one, then telling the whole truth will require every human voice. i trust that, one day, i will participate in that with you."

    "content": "what is privacy? “he said: what is the hidden letter? i said: knowledge that leads to reality. he said: what is the act? i said: sincerity. he said: what is reality? i said: that through which you disclose yourself. he said to me: what is sincerity? i said: toward your countenance! he said: what is self-disclosure? i said: what you encounter in the hearts of your friends.” – muhammad niffari what is privacy? niffari–a strange sufi mystic–offers us a unique way to consider this question. let’s try and reproduce what he is saying step-by-step for a modern audience. this piece was co-composted with octopusyarn. what is the hidden letter? article 12 of the universal declaration of human rights (udhr) addresses our right to privacy, stating that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon their honor and reputation. article 17 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) mirrors this, emphasising the prohibition of unlawful or arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. clearly, “arbitrary interference” is the issue. we might expect that privacy is how we protect against said interference, but in both statements, privacy is some thing alongside family, home, correspondence, honour and reputation. what is this thing which we have the right to protect from interference in the same way we might protect home, family, honour? the cypherpunk manifesto states that, “privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” here, privacy is not a noun like family, but a power. the manifesto goes on to explore the tension between privacy and free speech–both of which it posits as “fundamental to an open society”–and so advocates “that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction”. it’s fascinating to consider why privacy might be fundamental to an open society, especially when it is considered as a power to select how, what, and when you disclose something. so, our guiding questions as we explore niffari’s poem and its relation to privacy are: 1. what are we protecting if privacy is something similar to family, home, honor? 2. how does selective disclosure lead to open societies? knowledge that leads to reality our enquiry begins where free speech and privacy meet: communication itself. this is because as soon as something is communicated, it is interfered with. it enters into a symbolic exchange which makes it something other than what it already is. in this sense, privacy is like an asymptote we can never reach once we have the desire to communicate anything. the emphasis in the udhr and the iccpr is on the word “arbitrary”, just as the cypherpunk manifesto highlights that only information directly relevant to a given transaction needs to be disclosed. this helps us clarify things somewhat, because we can see that free speech has more to do with what information we select, while privacy has more to do with the context in which any information is revealed. you should inform your doctor about your haemorrhoids and your priest about your devious thoughts, but not vice versa, nor do such things apply to wider, public contexts. in his mathematical theory of communication claude shannon wrote that, “the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.” we might say that privacy is not about message selection, but about how the points themselves are selected. this is practical, in the sense that we need agreed upon protocols enacted at both points–like patient-doctor confidentiality, or the rules of confession, or the various types of key exchange necessary for encryption–for those points to become (and remain) valid selections. it is also philosophical, in that we must develop ways to discern in which contexts revealed information might create knowledge that leads to reality: i.e. in which contexts a message selected (and therefore already interfered with) elsewhere might be reproduced here such that the state that message represents might be accurately perceived. what is the act? the most surprising thing that i have discovered in more than a decade thinking about privacy and trying to implement it in different ways is that being truly honest–about anything–requires revealing so much information that it naturally obscures the real value and meaning of that communication from anyone not available to truly receive. cast in shannon’s terms: you must keep the channel open for so long and process so much information that it is simply too costly for most people. it requires significant, sustained motivation, which itself offers a kind of privacy premised not on obscurity, but on work. establishing private channels generally requires work to be enacted at both points. at the transmitter, it is the work required to be honest (even if that is just about how you create a key). at the receiver, it is the work required to receive with care. we must exchange the keys and encrypt the messages, or visit the doctor and describe our symptoms fully, or open the confessional window and ask for forgiveness. in all such acts–indeed, in all communication–you are trusting another with the discovery of your authentic self, because authenticity emerges from the process of selective disclosure, not prior to it. our reality is private–even from ourselves–until seen through the mirror of one another. the specific protocols (legal, technical, both, or other) by which you encrypt this simple fact are fascinating, but matter less than the fact itself: reality (however you interpret that word) is a private matter. this is not to trivialise such protocols, nor downplay the urgent need for them to protect against the dangers we face in our slice of space and time: tyranny, oppression, total surveillance states, narcissistic media perfectly formulated to sell into our particular habits and desires. the question i am posing here is: “how can we act to preserve privacy?” is it through a techno-legal arms race in which we develop alternatives to nation states premised on violence, and incorporeal companies premised on maximising shareholder value? or is it through cultivating a culture which values the sincere openness niffari is pointing at? sincerity of course, we need to be doing both. the point of this piece is to remind you that the cultural work is equally important and often overlooked. this is because it is not about a specific privacy-preserving protocol, but how to get at the root of privacy itself: how to perceive that which we keep private even from ourselves. niffari’s great gift to us is exactly one such way of doing this: sincerity. sincerity is a theatrical term: it assumes an audience, before whom one plays a role so completely that they can only suspend disbelief for the duration of the performance. can i perform my communication not for the sake of another, but for its own joy (without forgetting that there is always an audience); and can you interpret my communication so that the inevitable interference is constructive rather than destructive[^1]? if so, then what is exchanged between the participants is private in a different and deeper sense, one which perhaps even touches the asymptote, because neither can name nor readily conceptualise it. it is not so much communicated as it is uncovered in each party without ever moving between the two at all. what is reality? niffari tells us that such sincere exchange is, “that through which you disclose yourself.” there’s nothing to say about reality, though, precisely because it cannot be communicated. however, we can speak of knowledge about reality, which is what niffari calls “the hidden letter”. what is this hidden letter? my proposition is that it is “i”. i am both the letter which hides the truth, as well as that hidden truth itself. if i know who it is that is really communicating, and with whom it is being shared, then the very natural result is trust that–even if what is communicated is interfered with by another–it is so specific to its context that it cannot be understood without the equivalent work done to uncover this hidden, hiding “i” who communicates. it is about the points from which it emanates and where it is received, more than it is about the specific content transmitted. that said, openness does not necessarily mean communicating in the clear, or not acting to guard shared content in the same way as you would family, home, and honor. it just runs deeper: to an abiding availability to receive, coupled with an ability to transmit your natural state with as little self-interference as possible. towards your countenance! total honesty–true sincerity–pushes us right to the edge of the practical problems associated with communication in space and time, and beyond. “towards your countenance!” is the living recognition that every being you communicate with is an aspect of one, undivided reality. it is always–at all times and in all places, across all times and all places–just you talking to your self. when these are the terms of your communication, then openness and privacy intersect. what you say is so surprising–it contains so much information–that no-one but those equally open to experiencing the wholeness of this singular life can interpret it meaningfully. now, self-disclosure is really possible, because you know that what you will encounter in the hearts of your friends–regardless of the particular message passed in that moment–is nothing other than your self. again, it is this most private realization which binds us all together. what you encounter in the hearts of your friends the shape of the poem is worth reflecting on at this point. it presents as a dialogue between two, yet moves into a sincere, singular, introspective discovery: a disclosure only you can make. once the sincere act moves you toward your real face, asking again what this deeply private self-disclosure is returns one, finally, to the heart of friends. the cultural work is, following this same pattern, deeply individual and introspective and has to do with uncovering your own most private truth: this hidden, hiding i who is knowledge about reality. the techno-legal work is collective and is about protecting the hearts of our friends, in the same way we would protect family, home, and honor, just bolstered by the realisation that such sincere action is the same as protecting our own, newly uncovered heart. can we discern different kinds of receivers fully, as well as be cognisant of the media by which we communicate, while also remembering that irrespective of such choice (which determines the practical privacy of shared content), whom we are communicating with is always thou? if this is the culture within which all privacy-preserving protocols are built and used, then self-disclosure “at scale” is the natural result. can we cultivate the sincerity which extends beyond the time and space of a single life; which can withstand the scrutiny of all generations? can we communicate from this place, trusting that the results can only be revealed in those who do the same? to those who, in following the same, simple protocol–be honest, always–select themselves as points for this greater self revelation to home in and radiate from. --- if i admit, honestly, that i have no idea what to hide and what to reveal… then i arrive here: transparent, not in the sense of showing off, but more subtly, responding in full to all that each moment asks. now, what is made obvious is not obvious to anyone who does not care to make a full investigation. this is the great trick: i am honour bound, silenced by words which obscure what i have no right to: just another wayfarer who has finally stopped hiding and stepped into the revelation of all i can never know. [^1]: there is a lot being asked here. more of my thinking around this question can be found here. it may be the case, for instance, that deconstructing what another says is sometimes the most constructive way to interpret it. it all depends on whether one is suspicious or curious; whether you are looking for holes or seeking encounters in which both performer and audience are redeemed"

    "content": "reading as layered ritual > “live in the layers, > not on the litter.” > though i lack the art > to decipher it, > no doubt the next chapter > in my book of transformations > is already written. > i am not done with my changes. this is part of a favourite poem of mine; favourite because of the economy of language coupled with the infinitude of the poet’s ideas. in just 44 lines, kunitz covers life, death, friendship, family, god and the angels, the heart, “the turn”, art, fate, and the self. after sweeping us across this vast vista, the poet steps aside and offers some really simple advice, in a voice not his own: “live in the layers,/ not on the the litter.” having crafted a clever linguistic twist, kunitz declares his human limitation, his humility: that his “art” — i.e. this art we are reading right now, this poem right before us, which lays it all out — cannot decipher the real message. by declaring his inadequacy, even after getting out of his own way, the poem and poet perform incompleteness: a fundamental building block of our universe. however, natural language (and poetry especially, as “language against which we have no defense”) offers us a solution not available to mathematicians and cryptographers. the poem is only like ciphertext, flowing from somewhere beyond the poet and his art… what else could be required to decrypt it but you, and your inborn ability to interpret; to observe performance? you are the key; reading the ritual. further down the rabbit hole and there are also many different layers of observation to be explored, even in these last 8 lines. the poet’s “book of transformations/ is already written” — his fate sealed, even before the arrival of a new voice he lacks the art to decipher. the final line can be read as strengthening this assertion: he is not done with his changes because there are yet more pages already written in his book of transformations. however, we can also read it very differently, rendered as two distinct and juxtaposed ideas: his book is already written, but the poet has the ability to edit his own changes, to leave (at the very least) marginalia and other hurried marks that change grammar or repair syntax and make the overall meaning more clear. such poetic edits — like all marginalia — amount to adding layers to a text, altering one’s own changes while still moving within the total river of transformation to which we are all subject. they reveal how more than one mind moved through this particular forest of symbols, forging a different path to finish at the same point. we may not control fate, but perhaps it is possible to direct it by living in the editorial layers: not fighting inevitable change, but using direct and meaningful language like poetry to implement our own changes in dialogue with all this changing life, like so much litter left behind by less attentive souls. change without change i work in an industry obsessed with change and disruption. this is sometimes a blessing, because it can make people more conscious about what it is that they would really like to see change, though many continue blindly to rip out pages simply for the sake of being noticed. the more subtle point about poetic edits to the book of transformation is that they must be carefully considered from many different layers of abstraction (not just observation) if they are ever to produce more happiness than suffering. this is the key natural language offers that maths and science cannot. it gives us a metaphorical ability not just to observe and describe in the succinct eloquence of mathematical symbol; but also to abstract away and see the problem analogously from entirely different perspectives. one could say that natural language — with its implied multivariate observer — misses the ability directly to manipulate matter (which mathematics can offer us), but retains the ability to abstract over the whole picture and — much like a zen koan — give back the ground on which the problem first appeared, rather than provide a binary “answer”. the decision that then appears seems to be one of choosing which layer(s) you wish to change. i once had a fantastic conversation by a bonfire in berlin about exactly this with kevin owocki. it was mind-bending, but deeply inspiring, simply because he made the point that he was very happy operating at a different layer of thought and action to what i was prattling on about at the time. rather than trying to convert others to see the world the way you see it, it is in fact more comforting to celebrate the obvious fact that they don’t and never will. far from separating us, this gives us all the ability to take some slightly different position with regards to the same, simple ciphertext; kunitz’s aptly-named “book of transformations”. the certain slant of light that comes from our basic choice of which position and angle to observe from is the thing itself which ends up rendering the book in all the many colours of this one wild, precious life you have been given. so, pay attention. be astonished. tell about it. — mary oliver"

    "content": "title: rough consensus and running code description: a summary of the famous ietf working paper of the same title, updated for a slightly more modern internet as it exists 30 years later. rough consensus and running code \"he who defends with love will be secure.\" -- lao tzu this historical ietf document repeats - again and again - the simple maxim that engineering is really about tradeoffs. as such, we should develop clearer ways of thinking about how we make decisions. the overarching goal is to avoid the dangers of \"majority rule\" and get to rough consensus decisions which promote the best technical outcomes. rough consensus is therefore a sort of \"exception processing\", meant to deal with cases where the person objecting still feels strongly that their objection is valid and must be accommodated. balloting or otherwise looking at percentages cannot \"determine\" consensus in such cases. one of the strengths of this model is that minority views are addressed, with justification. simply having a large majority of people agreeing to dismiss an objection is not enough to claim there is rough consensus; the group must have honestly considered the objection and addressed fully all technical issues. this idea has taken hold among a certain kind of software developer and group of thinkers since the early 1990's. such people are what venkatesh rao refers to as \"breaking smart\". in his own take on the ietf's famous paper, he writes: > \"in its most powerful form, rough consensus is about finding the most fertile directions in which to proceed rather than uncovering constraints. constraints in software tend to be relatively few and obvious. possibilities, however, tend to be intimidatingly vast. resisting limiting visions, finding the most fertile direction, and allying with the right people become the primary challenges.\" pete resnick, the author, quotes a presentation from dave clark in order to establish his argument. in that same presentation (see pg 551), clark outlined what the ietf was good and bad at in 1992: what are we good at? 1. ̄responding to short term reality. 2. building stuff that works. 3. calling bad stuff bad. what are we bad at? 1. growing our processes to match our size. 2. setting long-term direction. it all sounds awfully familiar nearly 30 years later. the below only summarises how the ietf addressed this, which was mostly in the negative: i.e. consider issues first rather than agreements; address them but don’t accommodate them; consensus is a tool and not a destination etc. i think we have at least come to understand that the scarce resource of human attention, consciously employed, can be used to shape long-term direction in community-based, decentralised, and open-source projects. however, i’ll leave this for another time. alternatively, read my summary of swarmwise; this idea is outlined well there. 1. lack of disagreement is more important than agreement 1. determining consensus and coming to consensus are different things than having consensus. in determining consensus, the key is to separate those choices that are simply unappealing from those that are truly problematic. 2. consensus is when everyone is sufficiently satisfied with the chosen solution, such that they no longer have specific objections to it. 3. closure is much more likely to be achieved quickly by asking for, and trying to accommodate, the objections rather than asking for agreement. 2. the two meanings of \"compromise\" 1. among engineering choices, compromises are expected and essential. we always want to be weighing tradeoffs and collectively choosing the set that best meets the full set of requirements. 2. among people, far less so. such compromises occur when one group has given up trying to appease the others. conceding when there is an outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus. even worse is \"horse-trading\": \"i object to your proposal for such-and-so reasons. you object to my proposal for this-and-that reason. neither of us agree. if you stop objecting to my proposal, i'll stop objecting to your proposal and we'll put them both in.\" 3. rough consensus = issues addressed, not necessarily accommodated 1. \"that's not my favorite solution, but i can live with it; i'm satisfied that we've made a reasonable choice\" - this is not rough consensus. it’s only rough when an unsatisfied person still has an open issue, but the group has truly answered the objection at a technical level. 2. this relies heavily on the good judgement of the consensus caller, or chair. finding “rough consensus” means that not only has the working group taken the objection seriously, but that it has fully examined the ramifications of not making a change to accommodate it, and that the outcome does not constitute a failure to meet the technical requirements of the work. 3. what can't happen is that the chair bases their decision solely on hearing a large number of voices simply saying, \"the objection isn't valid.\" that would simply be to take a vote. a valid justification needs to be made. 4. humming, not voting 1. we don't vote because we can't vote. the ietf is not a membership organization, it's nearly impossible to figure out who would get a vote for any given question. there are only “participants”, not “members”. 2. one reason for humming is pragmatic: to find a starting place for the conversation. a hum can indicate that there were less objections to \"foo\" than to \"bar\" at the beginning of the discussion, so starting with the objections to \"foo\" might shorten the discussion. 3. another is to take the temperature of the room. a smaller bunch of loud hums for choice a and a larger number of non-committal hums for choice b might indicate that some people believe that there are serious problems with choice b, albeit the more popular by sheer number of people. 4. there is deep symbolism here: a show of hands might leave the impression that the number of people matters in some formal way. it doesn’t - see below. 5. the formulation and order of questions asked during a hum can have huge effects on the outcome: asking, \"who supports going forward with this proposal?\", and asking it first, can cause more people to hum in the affirmative than would for differently formulated questions, or asking the same question after some more \"negatively\" framed questions. any sort of polling, whether hums or even a show of hands, must be done with caution and should almost always be used to prompt discussion and questions, not to conclude the matter. 5. consensus is the path, not the destination 1. consensus is a tool to ensure we get to the best technical outcomes. 2. experience has shown us that traditional voting leads to gaming of the system, \"compromises\" of the wrong sort as described earlier, important minority views being ignored, and, in the end, worse technical outcomes. 3. again, you cannot confirm that there is consensus by counting people, it must be about the outstanding issues and whether they have been addressed. 6. one hundred people for and five people against might not be rough consensus 1. if there is a minority of folks who have a valid technical objection, that objection must be dealt with before consensus can be declared. this rules out vote stuffing. 2. it's the existence of the unaddressed open issue, not the number of people, which is determinative in judging consensus. as discussed earlier, you can have rough consensus with issues that have been purposely dismissed, but not ones that have been ignored. 7. five people for and one hundred people against might still be rough consensus 1. this one is the real mind-bender for most people, and certainly the most controversial. it generally occurs in the case of small, active working groups where an objector recruits many otherwise silent participants to their cause. 2. the principle is still the same: if the objection has been addressed, and the new voices are not giving informed responses to that point, it can still justifiably be called rough consensus. 3. sometimes, a show of hands can be useful; sometimes, it can be damaging and result in suboptimal decisions. sometimes, using a device like a \"hum\" can avoid those pitfalls; sometimes, it is just a poorly disguised vote. the objective nevertheless remains to protect against simple “majority rule” and get to the best technical outcomes. it's worth going back to venkatesh rao for some concluding remarks: > \"the consequences of this optimistic approach are radical. traditional processes of consensus-seeking drive towards clarity in long-term visions but are usually fuzzy on immediate next steps. by contrast, rough consensus in software deliberately seeks ambiguity in long-term outcomes and extreme clarity in immediate next steps \\[...\\] clarity in next steps counteracts the tendency to overestimate what is possible in the short term, while comfort with ambiguity in visions counteracts the tendency to underestimate what is possible in the long term \\[...\\] > \"in other words, true north in software is often the direction that combines ambiguity and evidence of fertility in the most alluring way: the direction of maximal interestingness.\""

this started life as one possible visual representation of a master's thesis i wrote at the university of oxford in 2015. it shows directly what the 11,000 word essay talks around: that there is a way to use language such that you can exceed the representational frame using language always already implies. more simply, there is a way for words to be more than they mean. the way this occurs depends upon your participation. you, this reader right now rolling these words over in your mind, face a choice. will you read this sincerely? the irony is that sincerity is a theatrical word: it means “to perform so whole-heartedly that the audience must suspend disbelief”. choosing to find sincerity here–rather than manipulation, or hubris, or madness–does not mean ignoring the fact that there is something inevitably performative about my words. they were written with you in mind, after all. it means knowing that everything is a performance, and being willing to inquire more deeply into who or what is being performed by this particular arrangement, rather than dismissing it as “fictional” or “unscientific” or “unquantifiable” or “irrational” or any other term your mind may conjure up. because the way for words to move beyond what words generally are depends on your participation, the diagram is not only concerned with language: it is about you, too. it is about how you are when you’re speaking, and how you are when you’re listening, and how those linguistic actions are created by the relationships which hold you at any given moment. as such, what follows is as much about self-knowledge as it is about the particularities of language. first, the story my supervisor, a lovely irish lady who specialised in south african literature, had me rewrite the thesis from scratch six times. after handing in the sixth version, i was sure that she would approve it, and that i could simply tidy it up, add the formal references, and hand it in at last. i was also convinced that it was the best essay i had ever written and (given that i was a young, occasionally arrogant oxford student) maybe the best essay ever written full stop. when i went for a consultation with her on that version, convinced she would heap praise upon me, she instead looked at me with concern and said that she thought i was likely very stressed and should consider seeing a mental health counsellor. this stung in a particular kind of way, because it wasn't a normal essay to me. i was writing about sincerity, truth, and singularity. i wanted the essay to perform its argument, rather than just contain more academic content. i was not content to follow the usual essay style expected at such a traditional institution. i had essentially pulled out deep parts of my heart and put them on the page (the writer's i chose were all writing about home, and they were all like me in some important way, stuck in similar kinds of contradictions, with similar kinds of pain and hope). for this, my supervisor called me crazy. i left her office dazed and defeated, and walked into a dizzyingly beautiful spring day. the contrast was literally breath-taking. i slowly walked home, taking a meandering route to port meadow, where i lived, on the edge of town. i was paging through the architecture of happiness at the time, looking for a few supporting quotes for one of the sections on ontological design, and i began thinking about the polarities i was experiencing at that very moment: deep depression about the essay, elation about spring; conviction about my overall course, total uncertainty about what to do next etc. i had also read at least some of jung by that stage, and knew of his notion of transcendent functions. if anything, these are generally drawn as a 'n' shaped parabola. but, as my mind wandered over all these things, one of the happiest insights of my life occurred, thanks to a simple question. \"what if i took that transcendent function joining two poles and flipped it upside down to make a smiley face?\" i asked. “would that be an architecture of happiness?” and, all of a sudden, this entire image flooded my mind, pretty much complete, rippling out like waves in a pond. it was a moment of total contentment. a few days after that, i rewrote the final, imperfect version of the thesis in a more structured manner, nearly killed myself, and attached this image at the end. i talked about it briefly in the mini-defence we had to in front of our class, but felt deeply misunderstood. i let it be and found a way to slowly rediscover the ordinary: a process which is still happening ten years later. i have only pulled it out once since then, and that was to make a simplified version as the social image for the final book in the blue book sequence, which i have been working on since then, largely as the primary method for slowing down and rediscovering ordinary life in the face of this extraordinary event that occurred. now, the lesson in the original image, you can see that one of the two \"harmonic oscillators\" in this pond which begin the whole process has to do with the polarity between gift-giving and manipulation. no gift really exists until received in good faith, but we can shift any possible interpretation ever so slightly by anticipating beforehand how our gifts might be received and adjusting the manner in which they move in order to make it more likely they will meet with good faith. to reiterate, the image ”rippled” into my mind. i view each polarity–each eye of each smiley face–as an oscillator. it is a moving, dynamic process, even though the sketch is necessarily static and two dimensional. one reason this matters is that it speaks to a deep aspect of what it means to live in balance. balance is not some perfected and static state: it is constant response, constant accommodation. balance is rooted in hospitality[^1]. the idea that a logic of anticipation applied to gift-giving can make gifts more likely to be received as such can be made less academic. that is, how we choose to interpret anything makes the difference between our experience in that moment being one of offering or suffering. it can be made more academic again by reading alfred korzybski. our ability to apply a logic of anticipation (i.e. to interpret in harmonic ways) can be enriched and deepened by investigating the notion of \"i\" and \"you\" (the second ripple). how you interpret these two terms specifically depends largely upon who you think you are. in short, if you see that \"i\" and \"you\" swap places constantly in any dialogue, then you might realise that the \"you\" you think you are has no inherent existence. realising this breeds genuine courtesy in any given moment, as you exercise your ability to interpret the world as you will without giving the you who interprets the status of separate existence. it is the stance of the soul before god, and is held in a frame of paradox (the third ripple): an impenetrable wall around the garden, guarded by an angel with a flaming sword. let's leave those ripples there and turn to the right of the pond. these oscillators begin with a book called complicities. what is it that makes us really response-able? that is, how are we able to remember in any given moment that we are both uniquely placed to interpret it like no-one before or after and that any such interpreter has no inherent existence, is never separate in any way from what is being interpreted; and then respond from this awareness? what awareness could merge such contradictory experiences? constant awareness of death: our own primarily, but also those who walk in front of us. in african tradition (and many others) the ancestors hold a critical, archetypal place of reminding us about death and our concomitant responsibility to live fully, as well as to heal what they might have ignored or hurt. we are medicine for the dead (who are still present in important ways), just as they are medicine for us. what this looks like in language is communal, reciprocal, dialogic. it is a call that invites your living response. you cannot ever know the state of another’s innermost heart, but you can discern from their language how they are in that moment of encounter. the way to do this is to notice how much your shared conversation includes. it’s not just negative capability, or the ability to remain in uncertainty without grasping after “truth”. it is positive capability: language which (by grounding in and pointing to) the community who gives it meaning, asserts contradiction as an organizing principle which can only be interacted with communally. if you don’t care about noticing pronouns–not in the sense of how you are identified, but in the sense of how identities constantly shift in dialogue–then it you can find such communal language, such positive capability, by listening for the inner music[^2] of each word. are you invited, as a participant in the mystery that is any encounter with another, to both understand what is being said and simultaneously dance[^3] with all that can never be understood? acceptance of death, both in terms of the debt we owe to those who walk before and after us, as well as deep awareness of the fact that we may die at any moment ourselves, deepens the foldedness and complicity we feel with all humanity. in 2015, i could not state it simply, so i went a more technical route through how we construct the stories we tell ourselves, and how we navigate the inevitable betrayal of portraying others in our stories (and our inner lives, there being no inherent difference between the two). technically, this can be achieved through shifting pronouns, sometimes using the second person, call and response, lyricism, repetition and poetic license, which all (in different ways) illuminate “you” and “i” in our differentiated sameness. if you are able to cultivate this capacity, to ask \"how i am feeling over there?\" as a dear friend once put it, then you will know that this is a powerful way to cultivate compassion, and to approach justice[^4]. if i do this, i know that no matter whose place i am portraying, the only way not to betray the trust this naturally entails is to realise that i would not do an atom's worth differently. not one atom different. my humanity is folded together, complicit, with yours. then i am living in remembrance. remembrance of the dead, remembrance of those yet to come; remembrance of this moment right now; remembrance of who i am. any thought, word, or action which arises from this state is naturally durable, in that it inevitably takes place in the right place, at the right time, with the right people, to the right degree. however, this \"rightness\", this remembrance of all beings before and after and right now, is an invention (of a sort). it is a useful state, because we are still talking about durability, and hence time. just as, on the other side of the sketch, the quality and depth of any interpretation i make based on the insight i have cultivated and the courtesy which is blooming in my now-opening heart primarily follow from the deep intention i have set. intention is a lovely practice, a living word, but it (like durability) is limited. it took reading hexagram 25 to fully understand how. intention lacks a certain spontaneity and innocence. you know this if you've practised it before, because it can so easily become heavy and dogmatic. however, sincerity can transcend our responsive inventions and our best intentions: this whole-heartedness with which we can play any role, knowing what we now do. this was the whole crux of my work. whatever follows from here was an unexpected, unintentional gift. always, the gift in the thesis itself, i pointed out that one good way to understand how sincere participation can lead us to encounter words in ways which exceed what those words mean was through the translations (of various kinds) that occurred in the texts i was studying. any translation implies a set of choices, which are all really about when to stop. “a translation is never completed, just abandoned”, like any good novel. so, your choice doesn't complete the work, doesn't leave you totally satisfied, but choosing to read this lack of closure and truth as another gift, rather than a debt; as sincere rather than manipulative; as a real portrayal rather than another betrayal; as an offering and not just more suffering: that makes all the difference. an example: one of the authors i studied, antjie krog (who was the lead reporter for the trc) wrote a book called country of my skull. in that book, she does a number of unforgivable things while describing all the unforgivable ways we treat(ed) one another. she plagiarises large sections from other authors without attribution. she quotes victim testimony from the trc - in quotation marks - but manipulates the words so they fit what she is saying slightly better. academics, with good reason, criticise her for it and basically throw the book out. but i think this sort of \"hermeneutics of suspicion\" just perpetuates what she is actually writing about. krog is an incredible, and incredibly careful, writer. she knew what she was doing, and still chose to do it. why? what is really at stake that such actions could ever seem justifiable to someone like krog? clearly, it's not truth, because she's not being \"truthful\": a fact that the hermeneutics of suspicion quickly identifies. could it be the singularity of this life, right now, just as it is? could it be that, in the inevitably imperfect translation (which does not refer only to the movement between afrikaans and english, but includes it), her work recapitulates the unforgivable nature of what she is writing about? if so, does the text not invite each reader to investigate in themselves, over and over in each new moment of encounter, whether they are able to forgive the unforgivable? is this not one way in which we can avoid histories that are static and nostalgic, rather finding ongoing reconciliation in the hearts[^5] of those willing to participate with/in history, realising their complicity? the questions stand regardless of whether krog thought in my terms or not. the validity of this inquiry does not depend on her state of mind: it is about you, the reader. how is the message she selected reproduced in this being here and now? even if she was intentionally manipulative for her own ends, your participation can redeem her text. we are beyond intention and invention here. it's not even about truth: the reconciliation is deeper than that. all that is left is a singular choice. how do we make such choices? how do we go on saying \"yes\" to life (to use viktor frankl's words) in the face of what we know about it: that life feeds on life to go on living. for that matter, how many of these kinds of choices has god made in the unfolding process of this universe[^6]? well, are you living in your self, or from your soul? are you in touch with the singularity[^7] you are, and i am, and everything is in its own way? is that touch intimate, loving? does it wake you up in the middle of your life, exactly as it is, without demanding more? this is, to the small extent available via wordy description, a taste of grace. and that grace, that gratitude, that contentment leads beyond your small self, beyond ontologies and ways of knowing, deep into life itself beyond the personality, and beyond your particular language. here, the you you think you are is de-signed, removed from signification, stripped bare, alone with the alone beyond time. it is also exactly designed for this, to make it here, to face this truth which only you can. it is dasein, being itself, and the song of it all. doubled in finding ways to slow down, and explore the many edges i have delighted in wandering on while i waited for the time and space to weave this all together, i put together (with some soul-friends) an educational program. i wanted to know if we can return to teaching and learning multidisciplinary subjects that are inherently connected to life. i wanted to know if we can do that in a peer-to-peer manner, as everywhere i looked, the signs that the traditional teacher-student relationship–which i think is archetypal–is changing. those signs have since become even more prominent with the rise of ai in popular awareness. however, i think the archetypal relationship of teacher-student, master-apprentice, guru-disciple began shifting the day claude shannon published “a mathematical theory of communication”, which shows that, “the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another.” one of the core concerns of most wisdom traditions is “transmission”. transmission–how “the living truth” or “the dao that can’t be named” can be shared between two or more people–is always closely connected to the notion of “permission”. though this has been abused in countless ways across the ages, it was also very useful: one can only teach after one has received permission in the appropriate lineage. it is a good psychological guardrail. however, shannon’s careful choice of phrase (and the negative sign it results in in his mathematics) shows that it is the reproduction, the work of the receiver a.k.a. the participation of the reader, which comes first. in a sense, all digital communication we now participate in flows from shannon’s mathematical theory. he defined the term “information” for the first time; named the “bit”; and set the stage for every network we now know. the archetypal teacher-student relationship has changed, because we now employ vast networks of electronic communication technologies, all of which depend for their existence on a formalism which places the receiver first. this is perhaps why “permissionlessness” and “decentralization” go hand in hand and are increasingly important in our world as it is. it is further justification for the idea that your participation can redeem any text regardless of authorial intention. however, this does not mean there is a revolution in education at hand, nor that anyone is absolved of responsibility. if anything, it puts more responsibility on each person’s shoulders: those projections which you once might have placed on the guru–who had the humility and experience to redirect them beyond his/her self–call to be seen within (both within self and within community). you are invited to keep the channel free of noise yourself, rather than relying on “external” error correction. you are invited–by the participatory, networked technology we all use now–to be as clear and honest as possible. can you read this sincerely? can you reproduce, in your life as it is right now, exactly or approximately, the message selected by god/reality/etc? of course you can: because your life is the message that was selected! can you live this joyfully? — written on april 25, 2025 as a “smiley face conjunction” appeared in the sky. i had no idea about this until the next day, yet still “[the stars themselves/ [are] our shared canvas](https://thebluebook.co.za/canto-xiv/consonant.html)”. [^1]: and genuine hospitality in our relationships depend on the freedom we have to change and restructure social forms. the guest is always strange, surprising, unexpected. the guest brings new information. thus, hosting in a balanced and response-able manner requires ongoing rearrangements of the familiar. now, realise that guests need not only be other human beings, or other beings at all. each moment is a guest to be welcomed; an invitation to another state of balance.

    "content": "the final belt begin again we start, always, with gratitude. i thank this life, which is not mine, but which i have been given to live. i thank my mother for bearing me, and thank the many women who raised me. i thank each and every woman - born and unborn - for giving life. i thank the sea and the sand and the great dune trees outside my window for watching over these words as they roll across the page. i thank the great cycles of water which make up everything and hold the flowing memory of us all, reminding each of us that everything is in worship, always. gratitude just makes us more aware of this simple truth. though i am not a native american, i too hail from a matrilineal culture: there is a call in this jewish blood i was gifted in my mother’s womb to which i cannot help but respond. we are people of the book. in arabic, they call us haadu or yahudi: those who have repented and been guided to the right path. what is this path? surrender; then love, honesty, trust, and conduct. i acknowledge that i cannot write the full truth. you must read it for yourself: it is inscribed on the guarded tablets of your own heart. however, i will tell you the story of the black wampum belt as honestly as i can, and trust that you will forgive me my limitations. singularity council begins, as i have, with thanks. thanks for sky woman, whose body we are within and which we see from the inside when we look up into the milky swirl of stars above us every night. thanks for grandmother moon and mother earth. thanks for the water from which all is made: this one, great current of endless life. thanks for each other, and all the means of our survival on mother earth; all the medicines with which we are constantly provided. you and i, too, are medicines: healing balms for our ancestors, just as they are healing balms for us. in particular, kaisitenserio gives thanks for the corn, a plant medicine engineered by the women of old to sustain us all. they still grow their own, and he is sitting there reciting his gratitude and reading a particular cob which he turns over in his hands, occasionally passing it to edith (who is translating all he says into spanish) to hold and read as he lights more sage in the bowl sitting between them. smoke and words and thanks mix, separated though we seem to be by these screens behind which we all sit. edith can translate into either french or spanish, but many people from south america have joined today. it is reconstitution day: when the eagle and the condor fly together. the spanish rhythms dance over the english words and play in the spaces between until kaisitenserio finishes his thanks and approaches the camera with the corn in his hands. he holds it up to each of our screens, spread across the world, and shows how one, single kernel has grown between all the other neat rows of corn, insisting on its unicity and pushing three kernels in both rows above and below it slightly up or down. “this is the story of all life,” he says. “everything emerges from one. we are one human family. it doesn’t matter where on mother earth you have appeared, what colour you are, what you believe, or who you think you are. we are one. and then, there is also duality. look,” he points to the two rows of three kernels, each slightly displaced. “look: two from one. this is how it works.” he holds the cob in front of the camera for a few moments more. there is complete silence. kaitsitenserio returns to his seat. “the non-native people have forgotten how to read these signs. they think it’s complicated. but all you need to know is right here, right around us. for me, given how i was raised by my mother, this means everything.” here, immediately, are two great lessons of the council and, indeed, of indigenous ways of being in this world. first, a deeply intuitive observation and awareness of every aspect of one’s environment at every level: the physical, material, emotional, psychological and spiritual (for they are not separate, but bleed into one another, like all the different parts of our own body). second, the embedding of this acute observational awareness in a cosmological narrative structure which can place any sign and render it meaningful in a collective sense (though it relies on individuals to take responsibility for seeing honestly). the riddle kaisitenserio then offers us all a riddle: in the great law of peace and the two row wampum protocols it is related that, when an individual who knows the law senses imminent danger to the nations rising and living, they must climb to the top of the tree of peace and survey the landscape. rendered literally: they have to go through the law to see if there is precedent for the current situation; reaching the top of the tree means going through the whole law. if that individual reaches the top, looks out to the horizons, and sees that there is indeed an imminent threat to the nations rising and living, it is their responsibility to warn all the people. however, and here is the riddle, what if there is no-one left to warn? what if everyone has left the house, has wandered away from the home fire and cannot hear the warning call? he opens this riddle to the floor and various disembodied voices echo in from around the globe. each offers something, but does not crack the full code. after many orations, kaisitenserio gives his answer. that individual must call everyone home, back into their own heart. his longhouse is not your home, but everyone needs to return to their own home; that place where your being is most familiar. the analogy offered is one of muscle groups in the body. each group is different, and each person must return to their respective group in the fingers and the palm and the wrist and the forearm etc., while keeping in mind that it remains one body within which we all exist. the black wampum belt later on, after discussing what he feels the actual threat is (it’s the covid-19 vaccine, a claim to which i will return), he comes to the raison d’être for this council. hanging over the table in front of him are a few belts made from wampum shells. he selects one made entirely from black (or purple) wampum shells and holds it up for all to see. this is the final belt. for those who know the law, who have cultivated the kind of acute, intuitive observational skills above, it is a terrifying sight. it speaks of a world deeply out of balance, one whose mind is entirely male-dominated (the black wampum shells are the males). it speaks of a world which is all about the abuse of power, profit, extraction, greed, commodification, and conflict. it is the last warning sign the native people have to offer, and it has not appeared for a whole cycle, or great year (25,772 years). kaisitensrio says it was activated the day before this council. of course, “final” has to be understood in the context of the cosmology we began with: one that intuits great cycles and was aware of something as subtle as the precession of the equinoxes long before the development of telescopes or modern astronomy. this belt is not “the end”. the warning it offers is one about what kind of mind we take with us into the next cycle: one that is patriarchal, conflicted and male-dominant, or the “good mind” we ask our ancestors to guide us back to. there is one more second to go before midnight, in which we have the chance to catch this belt or let it fall to the ground and start a great year which we will not survive. two rows, one belt later on, kaisitenserio discusses the two row wampum belt, which signifies the treaty between the british crown and the people of turtle island (what north america was originally named). this is a belt of white (female) wampum shells, with two rows of black shells down the middle, slightly separated. it tells of the two streams of life, like two rows of corn on a cob: the native and non-native, and their agreement to live and let live; to occupy the same land without interfering in each other’s affairs. i tell this part for two reasons. first, this belt offers a narrative response to the black wampum belt. for too long, we have been focussed on the male mind which insists on separation, on this stream of life and that one, and their independence. what about the singular, white background on which both are set? is this not what it means to restore woman to her rightful power? a unified world. duality must always exist - the corn shows that, as does literally any human experience within space and time - but it is always a question of how we choose to observe. are we looking at separate streams, or are we seeing what lies beneath both, without repressing the fact that there are indeed differences in this world? my teacher calls this differentiated sameness: see with the eye of unity or truth, without denying the eye of law and conduct. it is only both together which give us reliable vision. a corrupted world second, it speaks to the dissonance i experienced, about which i must write honestly in order to render my account in full. given that there are these two separate streams in the world of space and time - the native and the non-native - kaisitenserio makes the claim that the most obvious difference between them is corruption. the non-native world is one, extended sign of corruption. i don’t differ with this. i am, in addition to being born jewish, a white south african man. we are the worst of the worst. we are the only people in history to legislate separation, or apartheid as we called it in our language. we perpetrated crimes against humanity for hundreds of years on the tip of the continent from which all humanity comes. what we did here is abominable. however, it is also true that we can only recognise in others what is already within ourselves. if you see another as angry, jealous, envious, covetous, violent or corrupt, it is only because those possibilities exist within you too. if you posit that corruption only exists outside the stream of your life and way of being, then that is the thing itself which invites corruption in. trust a white south african man to know this experientially. a truly whole being sees that corruption, weakness, infection, decrepitude, decay, and death are all a part of the single, endless current of life, no matter which stream that current flows through. i am left with a very different sense of the covid-19 vaccine: it is a wonder of our ever-unfolding understanding of life at every level, as well as our ability to share and help each other in times of crisis. we need only go back to the point about our mothers and corn: we have been genetically modifying corn for at least 5000 years, consistently getting ever more precise. where exactly is the line between acceptable and unacceptable modification? to me, seeing the vaccine as a threat is based on a misreading of corruption. this is not to say that gene-editing technologies do not raise ethical concerns: they very much do and we need to address them together. my sense is that we require native understanding in order to set the intentions, goals and ethical boundaries for such research (which is actually the most challenging part and so is something modern science has avoided, to its own detriment), while continuing balanced research that is reproducible, peer-reviewed, and falsifiable. stop cycling so, where to from here? well, to finish the story: there was another two and a half hours of people from around the world sharing aspects of their lives and experiences, which was deeply moving and is not mine to share here. in addition to acute, intuitive observation and grand, cyclical, cosmic narrative; the practical emphasis on consensus and hearing every single voice in the circle is the last critical learning this council gave to me, for which i am eternally grateful. the two row wampum way and the great law of peace prepares the ground for a truly beautiful way of being. still, if not the covid-19 vaccine, then what is the real crisis? my submission: our inability to stop. to stop doing and just be. to stop the mind totally, be it native or non-native, woman or man. stop. sink into silence and go to the heart of your own being. there is no separation there; no sickness, nor any cure; nothing natural or modified; no peace nor any conflict. it is our inability, each and every one of us, to access this zone of consciousness within which is the actual crisis of our time. i read the real message of this council as being the answer to that first riddle: come home, dear one. come back to the heart’s fire. it is time to begin again."

    "content": "viewing time there is a wonderful paper from 1988 called “decoding the mysteries” which is all about the difference between reality and our knowledge about reality. the study of reality is called ontology; the study of what we know about reality is called epistemology. it may seem silly to use such big and unnecessary words, but reflecting clearly on the difference between what is, and what we know about it is the foundation of this essay. one of the most powerful linguistic frameworks we have for making this distinction technically is something called bayes’ theorem, which has to do with calculating probabilities. lies, damn lies, and statistics using bayes’ theorem, we can describe quantitatively the difference between prediction (about reality and what actually happened/happens/will happen next) and inference (our knowledge about reality and how it constantly changes). even if you’re not a statistician and couldn’t care less about the probable, knowing that there is a difference between reality and our knowledge of it allows us to clear up some seeming paradoxes. for instance, einstein famously rejected much of quantum mechanics because of something he called “spooky action at a distance” or what is now called “entanglement”. basically, if we put two subatomic particles in the same state, then separate them and measure one such that it’s probability wave function collapses; then the same must happen instantaneously to the other particle, no matter the distance which separates them. this means that the information about our measurement must somehow travel faster than light, which violates cosmic law as we know it, and therefore upset albert. however, it is not information which travels faster than light, but our logical inference. imagine you have a bag with 2 balls in it. there is 1 white ball and 1 red ball. if i pick a ball out and don’t tell you what it is, that doesn’t change your knowledge of what colour ball will appear next. but, if i pick another ball out and tell you it is white, then you can also make an accurate inference about what colour the first ball was (you know it was red). ‘measuring’ the colour of the second ball changes your knowledge about what colour the first ball might have been, but it does not magically affect its colour when i actually picked it out. it is time-independent ideas we are concerned with when calculating probabilities. all the time and no time at all another, more literary, way of saying this is that ideas – our knowledge about reality – exist independently of time and space, and therefore can be applied across it at the same ‘instant’ without violating any laws precisely because they do not exist within spacetime in any meaningful way. i think that’s enormously cool. it explains why books are magical time-travel machines, just as it hints at the mechanism behind singularities (scientific and those of social consciousness). however, the big problem is still to be faced. in order to share any idea, we have to describe it in some kind of language. and our languages are always-already bound to time (see arrival). it is this condition of linguistic description which forces ideas to withstand the “test of the real” in order to gain any lasting significance. if we return to the ontological level, though, we can see that any “test of the real” as we perceive it must itself be uncertain and incomplete (thanks, heisenberg and gödel). this may seem confusing, but is ultimately the scientific grounds for creativity. it is the little wiggle room between what is and how you relate to it which defines who you are and what you mean. models and metaphors in terms of our knowledge about reality: once there is conscious awareness of a pattern anywhere, that awareness is ‘everywhere’. ideas are not bound by time and space; only their descriptions are. however, description is exactly how ideas interface with reality: an idea that is never shared cannot be measured in an ontologically meaningful way. the world’s in our head must be reproducible by others through interpretation if they are to matter. here is the great trick: thought is a pattern that has the potential to ‘describe’ the patterns which constitute thought, though there are ontological and linguistic limits to the impact description can have on reality. however, that strangely loopy sentence, while seeming to describe a limit on thought, simultaneously performs the fact that these limits can be played with through the languages you employ to construct your model! the play is always centred on making your epistemology as general and extensible as possible. ironically, you can only achieve this by paying precise, ontological attention to the primitives which make it all up. primitives designed to express probability make bayes’ theorem a more suitable linguistic tool for understanding quantum mechanics than english or german. moreover, using a particular framework appropriate to probabilistic reality as the primary tool for constructing our mental model results in a clearer description of the critical concepts at the more general level of english or german, too. magic! it’s all about the view another way of thinking about this is that you want to choose your primitives for communication in such a way that they not only describe as succinctly and accurately as possible the kind of reality you’re interested in measuring, but also so that they can find meaningful application in as many different interpretations, or ‘views’, of the results as can be constructed. this was one of the core ideas behind doug engelbart’s work on nls, and the mother of all demos. by constructing as many views (epistemologies) of the same data (ontology) as we need, and by building into the interface the ability for anyone to make or alter any view they please, we can build “cyclical augmentation systems for collaboration” at scales never before seen. we can equip people to navigate the stored knowledge of our entire species in new ways, which is directly equivalent to describing consciousness more broadly. this, to me, has always been the real promise of computing. which brings us, finally, to the blue book. while many of the ideas from engelbart (and alan kay, and vannevar bush, and ted nelson, and tim berners-lee) still haven’t been applied, there are ways to think about using the internet itself as the user system engelbart described in nls; and using links between different sites (or views) as linguistic primitives for describing the ‘reality’ of a hyperconnected, modern life experience. the blue book exists as a website; a youtube playlist; a spotify list for when you’re on the go; a github repository with source code and all the public commits and data that go along with it; a goodreads list you can not only see reference material on, but also purchase it from; and as the social conversations that have sprung up, or that are woven into it through its many other links. admittedly, this is a very poor approximation of what the research at xerox parc (and elsewhere) was aimed at, but it is an approximation nonetheless, using only open source tools that are available today. it represents one, core reality while offering you at least six unique, and yet intertwined, ways of interpreting it. rather than concluding myself, i will let other voices summate. neti, neti > “where its power fails to serve my desires, it would be a mistake to blame such failure on the weakness of language. rather i should blame the weakness of my relation to language. if i fail to notice that i think and speak, under the influence of language, in patterns and constructs accumulated and preserved in the junkyards of long since vanished paradigms, then this shows my lack of consciousness with regard to just that power with which language can quickly make me spokesman for ideologies, in which everybody is almost always “right” at the “wrong” time. > > the dilemma is that neither insight nor good intention, not even syntactic and grammatical care, will protect me from becoming an ideologist as long as i am unable or unwilling to create the suitable language which speaks as i think and not louder than my thoughts.” — marianne brun \"a suitable language not louder than my thoughts\". brun was way ahead of her time, or perhaps just entirely outside it. > “in their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfill themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves.” — herman hesse"

    "content": "celebrate and eyes beholding radiance. and the gnats’ flickering dance. and the seas’ expanse. and death, and chance. — ursula k le guin “there is no such thing as non-fiction,” you said, poking the fire with a long stick and sending a flight of new sparks into the still night. “a friend once told me how, after years in the desert, he learnt that you either have water, or you do not have water.” you held up your hands, elbows balanced on your knees, palms pointing at the stars. “between these two things, there is no thirst. there is nothing. you either have water, or you do not have water.” we lapsed into silence as the stoked embers settled once more into a regular rhyme of red and orange. “follow anything for long enough, truly, and you will come to its opposite.” the fire murmured its soft agreement as i lay back to watch the past play out. “there is no such thing as non-fiction,” you continued, after some time. “there is only reality, and words. between these two is nothing. follow either far enough, though, and you might one day find that first word which was with god, and was god.” your voice played gently with the old idea as if it were a childhood friend. it also sounded, though, something like eternity, as if a great battle were just beginning and it had already cost you everything you were to come back from the frontlines and tell the story of that no-man’s-land. to describe – even for a moment – the territory so that eager cartographers could eavesdrop and try to draw their own crude maps. so that the world could take back, piece by carved up piece, your small offering until no bit of it remained and another would have to go back and find the secret in a line now long forgotten. we lay there, like so many dreamers have for untold generations, watching the silk flames and singing carbon and distant furnaces of the past above us, strung out in a giant map that somehow holds a hint about what it is to burn up and become again like air and heat and dancing light. we lay there watching the world turn; an old top – fashioned long ago and with great care – set spinning in endless space, suspended in a sunbeam, as if to remind us that this is the dream. that being here, for even one brief moment, is the greatest piece of fiction we each get to weave. there is no such thing as non-fiction: only stories which stitch this together, and those that break it open to reveal the bloody heart of the thing, broken and bruised and all the more beautiful because of it, because it somehow refuses to stop beating, even here – at the great world’s end. still a deep blue at the fire’s centre, if you look at it from this angle, between those two pieces of wood. see? see how colour, too, is simply a composition of heat, or wavelength, or frequency depending on which layer you want to look at. “the story insists on being told,” you whispered, watching the fire burn down. “and we keeper’s laid out here in the old dark – drawn back by forces we cannot comprehend, bar that they ask for things far beyond our own endurance – bound always to search for the words that will keep this dream top spinning, will keep that star beam focussed here.” strange, isn’t it? how much we struggle to find the song we’re each meant to sing and – for those that do – how it almost always ends up being built out of the most simple words. words like the dust you were, and the dust you’ll be again. just blowing across that open plain we stumbled over at sunset once, as kids in africa. or – if you’re lucky – perhaps the fine sea sand on cinsta beach, ground down by the endless indian ocean since soon after the world began. we knew – lying there in the pregnant night listening to the slowed-down songs of cicadas hidden in her folds – that now is not a moment in time. though we are made of time, consumed by time, burnt up by time like smoke from a woody fire – there are riverine dimensions to our being which flow with the benediction of water over all these grainy clicks. some carried to drift forever across the sands of our great face and dance in the brief summer rains, others caught in the rocks and washed in perfect circles for ten thousand lives. just so that you, walking along the ocean’s edge, might occasionally find an odd gift: all irregular bar a single, straight hole the size of a pencil right through the hard stone’s center. as if whoever had drawn this world into being had slipped just then, stuck the instrument through the canvas and left a gap wide enough to see through. as if this were the first word you had ever really found, right here in your palm. wholly yours, having spent so long swirling in the cracks, carving out a perfect shape with your imperfections. you chuckled softly, rolling over to gaze back into the fire. “yes,” you said, looking through the shimmering haze of heat at me, “the greatest stories we can tell are not love stories, though those come close.” i mimicked your movements, digging my hip slightly deeper into the earth to find a more comfortable position. “the greatest stories are pure celebration.” “to celebrate the sun is to make it rise again each dawn. to celebrate the moon is to lift a mirror in the darkness every night. to celebrate tragedy, to sing of our own transience, is to know that time doesn’t really pass at all. to celebrate the beating of your heart is to write one, long poem about your life and the love you knew: far more like a cold and broken hallelujah once all has been lost than those cute self-help books would have you believe.” then, the music; better yet than any word. come back to wash your feet and dip your head in holy oil so that you might wait – again – at the end of that stony garden, beyond the lines of olive trees, and accept with love the beat’s betrayal, because the kingdom is already here. it always was. it always will be. --- live here. look! take a step or two back so you see this small lake in the middle of a city park holding the half moon in it’s still hands as the starlings sing themselves into a sunset swarm, a swirling murmuration swelling to meet the music between things. all this love in endless layers: so lose your self forever. love that feels like light and lives in darkness. love that builds you up and breaks you, utterly. love like life and well beyond death. love as mysterious and obvious as gravity. love like the verb it is. love as lyrically as our first language. love without any sound at all. love bounded by this one life. love so boundless it takes a stupid poem about the moon’s reflection and roosting starlings even to hint at it’s hereness."

    "content": "father time for a year i lived next to the train tracks. passengers and cargo rumbled past on parallel lines which made the soft ground shake and dance. tiny frozen pellets piled next to the door shocked into springing life, resonating with the mighty, metal wheels of england. always turning. i would lie awake late at night, feeling each passing train, trying to guess how long it was, what it was carrying, where it was going. my mind would fall into rhythm with the shaking bed, carried far into blackness, always with those twin lines leading forth, faintly captured in the train’s headlights. the sound invaded my dreams, giving everything a mechanical, pulse-like feel. people spoke in staccato, waiting for the blinking red lights before proceeding, before unloading any of their hoarded cargo kept locked up in massive steel shipping containers. sometimes, back in reality, i would ride the lines myself, marvelling at the passing countryside; the still lanes and old runes in the distance – overgrown and crumbling. the mighty fallen into quiet fields and meadows where cows and sheep grazed, heads bent before the endless cloud. it felt like riding time back and forth, only the quiet whir of metal on metal and the odd screech of brakes to mark the passing moments, which seemed to get mixed up in late night stations built like great warehouses with a single clock hanging in the centre, firmly dictating its terms. it was so easy. gliding through domesticated lands to a strict timetable, everyone normalised to the system, swiping cards and tickets, hopping on and off. just another day of an endless, mostly grey, procession. i went to visit my family for christmas that year. my uncle and aunt had got divorced when i was young, so i barely remembered her. i just had a collection of stories and half-hinted at truths and lies from which i had built a composite picture around an empty name. she turned out to be nothing like what i had made up in my mind, for stories do not capture people; they capture the moments which people are doomed to outlast. it turns out that the stories we never get told are always far more interesting. it took two parallel tracks made of time itself to teach me that. after christmas dinner she went digging in a forgotten corner of her office. she came back bearing three albums in both her arms, tentatively cradled sepia memories, guarded by dust covers and layers of the other life she had come to lead for the last twenty years. the albums were made up of her and my uncle’s wedding photographs. gazing out from the still lifes of young and carefree people were both my parents, exactly the same age as i was on that cold and wet christmas eve. “you don’t look much like your dad,” my aunt mused, running her fingers over a photograph of the four of them together, smiling widely, flowers in the woman’s hair and the breast pockets of my dad and his brother. “but, when i heard you talking in the entrance hall, i could have sworn he had come back just like he was all those years ago.” i didn’t know what to say. i just looked at the four people so young i could barely recognise them. so full of life and joy and expectancy of what was to come. my grandparents are there, standing straight and tall at the marriage of their first son. my grandad’s arms around his boys’ shoulders, a picture of pride. my grandmother, breathtakingly beautiful, austere, graceful, mixes among the blossoms and flowers, wearing a grand hat that gives her, as ever, an air of mystery. a woman living fiercely on her own terms. at least, that’s how i like to imagine her. and my dad’s younger brother, he was there too. already half-fleeing from the frame. no-one ever talks about it. he stands at the edges, blond hair contrasting with his older brothers’ thick, brown side-partings, flopping over his eyes as the breeze blows gently past. his smile is the goofiest of the three and there’s some rare spark in his half-hidden eyes, something i’ve not seen before. did he know what was coming? what would have been the colour of that knowledge? he seems carefree, happy, completely at ease in this strange night. i sat there until early the next morning, paging through each memory, trying to imagine what it was like to be there, to have known my parents when they were my age. when they were young and stupid and naive and head-over-heels in love as the spring bloomed and rapt couples danced in the hall, doors flung open to let in the soft night. trying to imagine the parts of the chapel the pictures don’t show, the late night dancing that seems to have disappeared from the photographic evidence. at the very end was a pile of extra photos, not placed into folders. left-overs from history, unassigned. no words to compose the correct remembrance of all that cut off time. christmas ended and i returned to the tracks, following them over the horizon and back to my flat. i was addicted, you see; couldn’t get enough of the sense of going back on myself, finding all the stories that lead to me, here, now, which i had never heard before. i felt like they would be right around the bend, waiting for intrepid time travellers to be lulled to sleep and into the regulated dreams of railway lines. some months later i travelled down to london to meet my godparents. my godfather and my dad had been best friend’s for more than thirty years, had served in the army together when conscription was still enforced under apartheid, had climbed the corporate ladder together after completing their service. they go way back. often i’ve heard him tell stories about my dad – about how badly he used to drive his mini; about how they would get drunk in the hillbrow hotel, set the fire alarm off and then hose down the customers as they piled out in panic; about what a brilliantly intelligent man my dad is. over brunch, i got him to tell me about their time together in the army. there are some moments in history that are just unknowable. what it was like to be young in the summer of 1939 in london or berlin; or in the violent, death-strewn south africa of the 1980’s is truly unimaginable. there’s something which stops full knowledge of that time, some barrier the mind can’t overcome in its attempt to render it believably. yet, over orange juice and the full english, my godfather told me the story of my dad and one night in barracks. both of them were older than most of the men in the regiment, having been through university, so there was a somewhat strange relationship between them and the officers. the officers respected them, used their cars on weekends, listened to their advice, but nevertheless outranked them. on this particular night, south africa was exploding under increasingly harsh repression from the government. their regiment was ordered to make ready to move into sebokeng, a particularly violent township which was, at the time, pretty much engulfed in street war. my dad refused. it feels strange to write that, to try and imagine him standing in some bare barracks, a private staring at an officer, refusing to obey a direct order. it’s tempting to see him standing tall, speaking calmly with steel emanating from his green eyes. a hero. i’m sure if i asked him about it, he would say that it wasn’t like that, that it was more a question of what he felt he could and could not do, rather than standing up to the apartheid government. that he was scared. that he was young and heedless, too, then. that life is just one thing after another and we can never know which moments will mean everything and which nothing, nor which photos and stories our kids will one day sift through, looking for the real person behind ‘dad’. the regiment ended up standing down, baffled by the rooinek who refused to fight. my godfather told me another story after that, about one of their friends who had actually gone into the township some time earlier. he went into soweto on the day of steve biko’s funeral, to stand guard at the stadium where it was being held. the country was alight, literally milliseconds away from civil war. i don’t feel he was exaggerating when he told me that, had shots been fired at biko’s funeral, they would have been the death knells of any kind of democratic settlement which, as it stood, was still more than a decade away. having never fired his r-1, the friend took up position watching the angry mourners march past, defiance etched into their faces, their fists, their songs, their sadness. suddenly, about halfway through the day, a young boy appeared from nowhere and threw a burning dog into his hands. he dropped his gun as he groped to put out the flames. luckily, nothing happened after that, or maybe everything happened after that. who can tell? the boy looked at him for a long time and then walked away. as i finished my eggs, i heard about how close we really came to full war on a day in 1977, and about how my father sat in his barracks, refusing to bear arms against his own countrymen when it came to be his turn. what did apartheid do to those young men, bearing burning dogs and shooting unarmed children? how did we recover? did we recover? time haunts us, as we fly back and forth between memory and ‘real life’, twin tracks tracing each other; always separated as they stretch behind and before us. shaking every time a train rumbles over. singing strange, metallic melodies to rhythms we don’t always recognise. there’s a photo of my dad above my parents bed, framed in white by my mom. it’s my favourite. he’s staring down along the beach – wind gusting through his thinning and grey hair – our old german shepherd standing next to him, ears to attention. he seems absorbed in some memory, some fleeting thought of lives passed, each leaving its mark in his green eyes. in the background, the deep blue indian ocean stretches on forever."

    "content": "rivers of you it thunders through me, like i remember it always doing. no stopping it, this upwelling like some lost sailor pulled to the surface by generous bonds, pushed by moonlight to the shore. washed up in a way that no orderly line can capture, full of fragments and broken pieces of belonging that need now, briefly, to be placed together. some secrets must be let out of the chest eventually. i have never felt before such a need to relieve. not to reveal, or give away meaninglessly the contents of encrusted time. only to nudge, to play my feet against it as we did that summer, tangled in sheets and sweat and blazing sun. walking out later to watch the stars dance on tiny wavelets in the night wind over sand and mirrors and so much past. it was with me that moment the dream died by an old river, waiting for what i still cannot name. for what is nameless, just longing and love and the sense of something left over from the start. hineni. here i am, a lightning rod for time. sitting in wonder at the humility of lichen, knowing that it, too, will light up in a certain slant of sunset. i once kissed a book and meant it, deeply. i have loved the dead and sung them lullabies so that we might all remember what once it was to live. true hope is without expectation. it has so much more to do with rhythm than with the kind of sense you have been trained to expect. way beyond comprehension lies the silent line of truth. a breaking wave at sundown and a shoulder dipped into the foaming gold to pull across the curved surface and come to gliding rest beneath the dunes. and here, the love who will slowly undress my spirit, bring my body back to belief. to the unspoken knowledge that what separates leaf from air, salt from skin, is not a gap but a seal. that living by lies or by truth makes no difference, so long as it is not a person’s depths you discover, but their ascent. we carry each and every generation in our blood. how many years before the spirit forgets the body? there is no way to say what is known right now, no means to reach the outside world from here, buried as we are in the hearts of others. no memory to lean on, not even music. just the compulsion to put words together magnetically, feeling forces that can’t be seen and learning again to love each letter of the alphabet, though it contains so many tears. how could it be otherwise, for the lover who believes so completely in language? there is no ordinariness to return to, no refuge from the blind potency of things now. it is all as one: an old sword-maker reciting tales to the beat of folded steel. each line precisely timed – the story a recipe for what must be done. everything is malleable in the end. compulsion and revelation have more in common that we think. here lies the catastrophe of grace and a kabbalist who believes in the power of incantation. a singer of a dark language to match the music, now returned, of a distant harp played by a pilgrim outside the gates to a new city. still in the early morning and full of strange smells. beckoning. lucid torture and utter freedom, sealed like salt and skin with the recipe for honey cake, passed on in secret through the rivers of you."

    "content": "a new community: the language of morrison and mpe supervisor: minesh dass rhodes university honours in english literature february 14 2013 words: 10101 shared meaning once, we were warriors, and we wrote a group research essay on the south african writer ivan vladislavić, entitled “imagining the ‘unimaginable latitudes’”. in the course of that work, it became apparent that the attempt to imagine “the unimaginable” (vladislavić 13); or orpheus’s attempt to gaze on eurydice; or any attempt to quantify exactly what the scarlet letter; or the phantasmal, iconic, moby-dick; or what kurtz’s final, horrific words mean must suffer from the same difficulties as those pointed at in what follows. therefore, the primary focus of this supposedly individual essay is rather that most ancient and important feature of unimaginable words: the community which give them meaning.[^1] language which reflects communal meaning - and community which employs self-reflexive language consciously - requires immersion, along with recognition of all participants as valid members in a matrix of belonging, in order for any utterance to be understandable. writers like toni morrison and phaswane mpe are exemplary in their attempt to re-inscribe the community which sits at the heart of any consensually-arrived-at word. when reading them, one comes to realise that both are attempting to use language to give meaning to and extend that which gives language meaning: community. in a similarly self-recursive vein, the truth is that ‘i’ cannot write an essay which changes anyone’s conception of language but ‘my’ own.[^2] however, it is only in acknowledging this, and pointing to the infinite possibility allowed for by derrida’s “différance” (18), that we can even hope to achieve the aim of this paper: an old sense of communal language rendered anew for a hyper-individualistic age. we ought to use language in a way which displaces (as opposed to ‘removes’) the individual as our central concern and which, instead, expresses a communal sense of knowledge and its various manifestations. in using language, the aim should be to emphasise the community which invests it with meaning. if we do so, we can presumably overcome the contemporary tendency toward excessive focus on the individual and find more wholesome ways to tell stories, in all the multi-faceted complexity that defines life (and meaning) within any community. moreover, we can do so in a way which escapes the violence we commit to any object, person, or idea when we conceptualise it through words and description.[^3] even if the language we employ in narrative acknowledges the community as the very thing which makes communication possible at all, this inclusive approach can still do violence to “the other”, but not if its structure simultaneously recognises what is technically called “alterity” (levinas 47). the basic idea here is one of differentiated sameness: the root from which all meaning comes is one and the same community. how it is expressed (i.e. the particular stories we choose to tell and the mechanisms we employ when telling them - like call-and-response or strangely mixed pronouns), allows for and can in fact encourage differentiation or otherness. the community within which any individual is located consensually arrives at the basis on which the discourse which represents it is built. if the language we choose reflects this basic truism, then ‘i’ can only ever give a partial definition of a community. much like eurydice, where to actually gaze on her is to de-form her, to invest her with a form she does not have; to define community as an individual is to de-form it and warp it onto my own, prejudiced views of what it is or should be. in recognising this, we can look to achieve the hospitality that derrida spoke so highly of toward the end of his career – it all begins with the acknowledgement of eurydice as “the other night” (blanchot 171); of “the unimaginable” (vladislavić 13) as precisely that; the scarlet letter as an irreducible symbol still “capable of being loved” (hawthorne 63); moby-dick as god, dumb brute, “monomaniacal” (melville 241), malevolent nature and fate all-in-one; and an acknowledgement of the undefinable community at the centre of a consensually-arrived-at language.[^4] hopefully composed in such language, this essay will look at two primary texts: toni morrison’s beloved and phaswane mpe’s welcome to our hillbrow. the idea is to point at morrison’s text as an example of how community can be created through language and then extend this sense of community by looking at mpe’s unique techniques. perhaps how we read and write can thus be refocussed on the community which exists at the centre of language. perhaps this will help generate more meaning-full discourse and interaction. i sing in our chain first, the foundation: modern community is defined by exclusion. i know that ‘i’ belong because ‘i’ am able to say that another does not and support this with a reason – be it creed, colour, religion, sexual orientation or any other arbitrary feature ‘we’ agree on. the only thing that a community cannot exclude is exclusion itself, as this is its founding principle.[^6] it is the use of ‘i’ which creates all the contradictions: it posits an individual existence within a language which has meaning only through communal consensus.[^7] in attempting to define this ‘i’, we are forced into the quasi-scientific procedure of considering the individual and then the individual's context and then the epistemological systems surrounding that individual ad infinitum in an ever-narrowing spiral toward the completely incomprehensible. what happens, though, if we define community as a generative, dynamic process in the same sense as the consensual meaning which arises from language? community, in this processional view is not inclusionary or exclusionary, but rather about one’s relationship to a constantly shifting matrix of relations. community includes us insofar as we relate meaningfully to the language it develops within its boundaries and it excludes us on account of the fact that the self can never fully be defined in language, which forms the basis for any community. this is illustrated by the question “who are you?” there is no one answer that i could give which would be absolutely complete and so there must exist a part of ‘me’ which exceeds language.[^8] this leads to an interesting conclusion: the idea of a ‘global community’ is quite obviously impractical, but if we can begin to understand the duality of both always being a part, and always being separate from, any community in which we are involved, we can begin to generate interactions between different communities. mpe shows us that meaning-full interaction is still possible (even if we can’t communicate with others due to an actual language barrier) through rendering a famous english quote in sepedi and translating a sepedi idiom into english.[^9] in so doing, the south african writer proves that we can recognise how different languages can be used to express the same sentiment and so begins to come to grips with what he calls “the world of our humanity” (mpe 113). --- if you’ll forgive it, we must make a shamelessly shandian digression[^10] to “trace” (derrida 16)[^11] the idea that language structured such that it reveals its own ‘failure’ to give full voice to the community which invests it with meaning, is pivotal to meaning-full expression. this involves at least some philosophy, for language which does this brings us to understand that such ‘failure’ is the condition of possibility for any meaning whatsoever. this particular kind of linguistic paradox was perhaps at its height in the elizabethan ages, as seen in the concept of a felix culpa, or happy fall, of man through adam’s so-called original sin. we have in this communally-accepted construction a deep and unique awareness of the plight of humanity, caught as we are between the bestial and the divine. e. m. w. tillyard, in the elizabethan world picture, argues that the dual nature of humanity was commonly accepted knowledge at the time. in fact, it is precisely this communally-accepted paradox at the heart of what being human means (potentially divine, potentially bestial), which led to the kind of language which still scans profoundly today. just consider one of hamlet’s (many) soliloquies: > what a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! > how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how > express and admirable! in action how like an angel! > in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the > world! the paragon of animals! and yet, to me, > what is this quintessence of dust? > (hamlet, ii, ii, 295-300) the elizabethan world is a nuanced and complex place to understand from a modern perspective. there rests at the centre of this world view a great chain of being (tillyard 28) which connects everything with everything else, defining one’s position in life relative to the world around one and requiring each individual to perform a specific function in order for the entire picture to be in harmony. concepts like harmony and order are at the forefront of the elizabethan mind-set and it is thus that they can conceive of the entire universe as one piece of music, which requires all parts of the orchestra to perform as directed for symphonic and ordered sound to emerge. the concepts of order, harmonic music, and a chain of being all work together to bring about a unique conception of language as being intimately bound up with life; for language is the medium through which order (or disorder) is propagated. why spend all this time talking about chains and falls and paradoxical harmonies? well, work written in the elizabethan era which has survived to the present day, is the direct result of writing from a perspective that is not predominantly concerned with the individual, but is rather about a far more general concern with the role of humanity in the order of the universe and the ever-present possibility each person houses within themself to become either bestial or divine.[^12] this is not to say that the elizabethan picture of reality was perfect: the idea of free will, for instance, is too dynamic a concept to be contained within a static chain of being. this has been further complicated in modern times with the ‘death of god’ (nietzsche 108) and the assertion of fundamental uncertainty and relativity.[^13] it follows that the greatest issue most modern people still have with the elizabethan world view is that it is too hierarchical and does not allow for the free and unhindered expression of individuality. however, this whole essay is based on ousting the individual from the centre of our conception of language and therefore on emphasising a different way of perceiving the “world of our humanity” (mpe 124). which leaves only the modern feeling of an autonomous, free will as a hindrance to returning to a more elizabethan-like conception of the world (if, that is, we wish to replicate the powerful and meaning-full language that seems to be a hallmark of that age). schopenhauer, gloomy though he may be, enters the debate here, as he argued for a philosophy that has - as its central tenet - the “will to live” (schopenhauer 5), which is something very different from individual “free will”: > every glance at the world […] confirms and proves that will to live, far from being […] an empty word, is the only true expression of its inmost nature […] the will to live […] lies at the foundation of all explanations… [and thus is] the kernel of reality itself” (schopenhauer 5) this “will to live” which is the “kernel of reality itself” is common to everyone. we are bound to propagate life by means of the exertion of our will. each exertion has the appearance of individuality, though this seemingly individual expression is forever rooted in the shared, perpetual, ongoing nature of life itself. while it is certainly true that only the individual can meaningfully experience anything that is felt, this paradoxically leads to the insight that the communal “will to live” is transcendent. it is universal. indeed, schopenhauer claims that we know the will primarily by recognising it as the immediate root of our own being, and secondarily as characterising everything else around us. so, the question of feeling/knowing the will is inescapably paradoxical. the individual perceiver comes to see that s/he does not exist as such at the deepest level of reality, which is one and undifferentiated - and only comes to knowledge of herself through an acknowledgement of communal consciousness. our shared will to live “lies at the foundation of all explanations” (5). it is the “ding an sich” (kant 34) about which we cannot, sensibly, say more. therefore, we see at the centre of both the elizabethan world view and schopenhauer’s philosophy one basic premise: the lack of an individual consciousness, which is replaced either by a prescriptive chain of being (tillyard 28) or a communal “will to live” (schopenhauer 5). incidentally, schopenhauer and the elizabethans would also have agreed about music being the highest form of art, because of its ability to represent directly, as opposed to language which can only ever be a representation of a representation of the ding an sich. both metaphorical models - the chain of being, or the communal will to live - can be used to overcome the need modern people feel for some assertion of ‘free’ will. these models allow for an elizabethan-like world view with the amendment that the individual is a more like the pause between notes which renders meaningful the entire symphony by virtue of its relation to a shared sound which “forms the foundation of all explanations [… and is] the kernel of reality itself” (schopenhauer 6). just as with eurydice, kurtz, moby-dick, and the scarlet letter; there is an emotional directness in music that one cannot describe, which is perhaps why both morrison and mpe’s most important renditions of community tend toward this same, lyrically indescribable sound. beloved and positive capability the references to music are of particular import given the narrative techniques toni morrison uses. beloved is one of a very select group of novels which can justifiably be called monumental. this refers both to morrison’s claim in her famous essay, ‘a bench by the road’ that a new canon of literature was required to “re-memory” (beloved 61) the slaves and the tragedies they suffered, as well as the immense achievement of the novel in doing so with such depth, force and power.[^14] it is the language in beloved which most imparts these qualities because the american writer uses it to create a monument so different to any one we might visualise. by refusing to sum up, or truly encapsulate, the reality of “sixty million and more” (epigraph to beloved) her words signal “deference to the uncapturability of the life [they] mourn” (nobel lecture, 1993). it is this “ineffable” reach toward description of a history we have willingly forgotten which makes the novel so poignant. it is the fact that our self-consciousness – that which affords us “a glance […] into the interior of nature; inasmuch as this is nothing else than a glance at our own inner being” (schopenhauer 6) – recognises the shared truth of our human condition in such a description of history which truly haunts us about beloved. morrison asserts that “language can never ‘pin down’ slavery, genocide, war. nor should it yearn for the arrogance to be able to do so. its force, its felicity is in its reach toward the ineffable” (nobel lecture, 1993). one can barely help noticing remnants of keats’ “negative capability” in her ideas; that ability to remain in “uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason” (keats, letter 21 dec 1817). certainly, both writers recognise “that language can never live up to life once and for all” (nobel lecture, 1993), but after this, they start to differ. for keats, we must allow contradictions to exist so that we may get at the “beauty” of what is described, to the point where such “beauty obliterates all consideration”. he argued that if one is able to generate beauty, then truth must naturally follow (‘ode on a grecian urn, ll. 49). for morrison though, language is caught up in the greater circle of community, ritual, healing, memory and repression. language is not an abstraction that allows us to appreciate different possibilities simultaneously; it is a force that requires our interaction with all its different possibilities to signify at all; “we do language. that may be the measure of our lives”. the creative nature of words like “re-memory” (beloved 61) implies both the personal and communal: memory is a personal phenomenon; re-membering is something done together, through the medium of a shared narrative (which is also capable of acting on the personal memory that gives rise to it, as in any dialogue). morrison’s words and sounds are more than just the concepts that they signify; they become woven into the interplay of “différance” (derrida 18) and “trace” (6) which constantly supplements our understanding and allows us to locate ourselves within a space; relating and singing and dancing and crying with all the others. the difference between negative capability and morrison's approach lies in her specific purpose - “i was pleading for that wall or that bench or that tower or that tree when i wrote the final words” (‘a bench by the road’) - other than the abstractions of beauty and art in which an author like keats was interested. in order for her writing to achieve this purpose, she ritualises her text; lacing it with a barely readable lyricism which is not just beautiful and true, but terrible too, so that we may come to appreciate why “this is not a story to pass on” (beloved 324). in order for the healing morrison seeks to occur, her novel must be both a recovery of, and from, our shared history. it is both an imaginative and actual reconstruction of the past so that we supplement the authoritative discourse with our own interaction as readers. this mirroring technique lies at the very heart of beloved; sethe’s individual processes of recollection and “re-memory” are reproduced on an historical level so that, as sethe heals, so can the reader.[^15] the techniques used to achieve this include the fragmented nature of the plot: sethe’s crime is not revealed until the intensely-personal context of slavery is described so that we do not jump to an easy judgement of her action. morrison also uses a shifting narrative voice which allows for call-and-response, a key part of traditional african-american music.[^16] for instance, beloved’s cry of “tell me” (beloved 267) is a call requiring a response from both sethe and the reader; it calls for some explanation or justification which seems just beyond our reach. call-and-response also creates some of the more haunting passages from the novel, such as baby suggs’ preaching in the clearing. her voice permeates this essay too, reminding all that: > ’here [...] in this here place, we flesh; we flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass. love it. love it hard. yonder they do not love your flesh. they despise it. they don’t love your eyes; they’d just as soon prick em out [...] and o my people they do not love your hands. love your hands! love them. raise them up and kiss them. touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face ‘cause they don’t love that either. you got to love it, you! (103) here, not only are we told to respond, but to actually touch the members of the community invoked by morrison’s words. the second person narration at the end of the quote complicates any interpretation: who is talking, and to whom? this almost physical power, combined with palpably oral techniques, such as repetition of phrases like “nobody saw them falling” (beloved 205), “crawling-already? baby” (142) and “this is not a story to pass on” (324), means that morrison is able to simulate the aural, participatory, communal nature of ritual in the private world of her text. the musicality we find in such instances is genuinely notable. it serves as the link between morrison’s work, ‘the elizabethan world picture’, schopenhauer, and mpe; connecting everything with everything else. music is central to both the manner in which stories are communicated, as well as the experience of the stories themselves. this essay began by arguing that we must use language which points at that which informs its words with meaning if we are to reconstitute a lived sense of community appropriate to our time. how, mechanistically, are we to do this? well, musicality is a good start: this sound somehow exceeds the representational framework of ordinary language, so its overt use in - for instance call-and-response sections of a text - can harmonise that which is included with that which is excluded. its tone can re-member that which is inevitably left out, if you’re willing to listen closely. lengthy examples are numerous, but a brief excision must suffice here: > i will never leave you again > don’t ever leave me again > you will never leave me again > > you went in water > i drank your blood > i brought your milk > you forgot to smile > you hurt me > you came back to me > you left me > i waited for you > > you are mine > you are mine > you are mine > > beloved, 256 [^17] we cannot understand the “ritual chant of possession” (krumholz 117) above in and of itself – it must be understood by interacting with the text as a whole so that much more than a mere story gets passed on. what should be passed on is an understanding of both what the story says and what it cannot say because this is what it means to use language in a non-exclusionary fashion. love this sound the very structure of language cannot withstand the attempt to interiorise beloved. as the narrator says, “the leaves are not for her she fills the basket she opens the grass” (beloved 248) and, in some of the more experimental moments of the novel we get this almost unintelligible, though deeply haunting, lyricism. the point is that we cannot even understand such lyrical writing, and thus beloved, through “negative capability”. morrison is showing us the inability of language to express appropriately certain pivotal experiences, such as the middle passage, which are, quite literally, unspeakable. therefore, she draws on traditional, oral notions of call-and-response in an attempt to arc toward some valid meaning beyond the confines of a language that both oppresses and is oppressed by individual history. perhaps it is only communally that we can understand certain things? this communal understanding, far from accepting contradictions as a necessary part of seeing the beauty behind, exceeds the contradictions imposed by language entirely. for instance, when ella and the women of the community approach 124 to intervene as sethe is held in thrall to beloved, they move beyond mere words: > “they stopped praying and took a step back to the beginning. in the beginning there were no words. in the beginning was the sound, and they all knew what that sound sounded like” (beloved 305). this leads one to an entirely different kind of beauty. call it what you will, but it is not (just) aesthetic; it is the (sometimes terrible) beauty of a mother’s love, a man’s love, a sister’s love, a daughter’s love and the love of a human heart that knows that its beat belongs to one. the musically-ritualised nature of the work leads to an understanding of knowledge as spiritually-derived, context-dependent, multiple and collectively-asserted. this is so much more than keatsian “negative capability”; morrison is not merely allowing for contradiction to exist, she is asserting it as a ruling principle which must be interacted with collectively. for her, interaction - achieved through ritual and epitomised by music - is the key to understanding and thus to healing. just as the individual notes in a symphony are not as important as the combination of all into a cohesive, harmonised whole, the reader must interact with the implied community in the text in order to come to any meaningful understanding of morrison’s monument. such interaction would seem to indicate that a central tenet of her philosophy is that good and evil are not static moral dictates, but rather, arise from “the method of characterizing, judging, understanding and distributing knowledge” (krumholz 110). these ideas are best exemplified by baby suggs, holy. she says, “everything depends on knowing how much [...] good is knowing when to stop” (beloved 102). for baby suggs then, morality is not definite; it is based on the method of engagement and interpretation rather than on some god-given dictate that can easily be defined. consider: > it started that way: laughing children, dancing men, crying women and then it got mixed up. women stopped crying and danced; men sat down and cried; children danced, women laughed, children cried until... baby suggs, holy, offered up to them her own great big heart. (103) keats would have wanted us to appreciate the possibility that women can both dance and cry simultaneously and that there is indeed great beauty (and thus truth) in either. however, through the application of her own “great big heart” (beloved 103), baby suggs brings them - and the reader - to understand that dancing and crying are not just things of beauty; they are actual ways of understanding the world. one cannot understand beloved (novel or character), or truly appreciate the beauty of morrison’s words, if one merely reads them – one has to dance and sing and cry with her.[^18] in order to do this, we must necessarily engage our communal “will to live” (schopenhauer 5) as we are trying to discover the “ding an sich” (kant 34) at the heart of this monument; this shared history; this trauma we perpetrated on one another; and the path we must tread together in order to heal. at the heart of any appreciation of beauty (and meaning or ‘truth’) lies a sense of the communal, a sense of the connection we share with every being - indeed with all being. this is as beautiful as literature gets. --- beloved, then, is precisely that which defines the difference between morrison and keats. typically keatsian, she is both the pain and the cure, the catalyst and reactant. however, morrison makes her more than the ghost haunting sethe, or the ghost of shame and powerlessness that paul d faces, or denver’s ghost of remembrance and re-memory, or even the reader’s ghost of a past communally and culpably forgotten. beloved contains so much more than mere “uncertainties, mysteries, doubts”. she is, quite literally, the living embodiment of such uncertainty, mystery and doubt. morrison does not allow us to let beloved merely exist because she consistently evades any sort of definition. we cannot properly call her a ghost, nor can we call her a human. she both symbolises the past and catalyses the future, caught up in the contradiction inherent in her very existence, that she is both symbol and irreducible personality. in this sort of complex interplay and connectedness, i believe beloved comes as close to the greatest characters of elizabethan writing as any modern character in the canon. as already pointed out, the attempt to interiorise her fails as language cannot properly quantify her. we encounter a similar ‘failure’ of language in the tragedy of king richard ii when richard is asked whether he will abdicate. this is his response: > ay, no. no, ay; for i must nothing be. > therefore, no ‘no’, for i resign to thee. > now mark me how i will undo myself: > i give this heavy weight from off my head. > (iv.i.200-4) there are at least three distinct, and disparate, ways in which we can interpret this ramble, but the point is that richard’s sense of self, position and purpose is so intimately tied up with the way he expresses himself that when this position is challenged, his language too breaks down. shakespeare uses this to create pathos for the loss of a definite, and definitely signifying, language ultimately guaranteed by god. the breakdown of language in morrison’s text points at something different: it was never god who stood as guarantor of meaning in language. the middle passage (i.e. the transportation of slaves across the atlantic) precludes this interpretation, and forces us into a lived realisation that language, ultimately, can only ever signify what the community who invests it with meaning is willing to face. signification is limited to the dynamic of who’s in and who’s out; how permeable we are able to make such definitions; how directly we can express the inexpressible, or imagine the unimaginable. it is a function of how clearly we can see that the otherness which defines ‘us’ as a community is at the heart of what makes each of us an individual worthy of belonging. consider this lyrically elusive, allusive middle passage that leaves one feeling, appropriately, completely as sea: > all of it is now it is always now there will never be a time when i am not crouching and watching others who are crouching too i am always crouching the man on my face is dead his face is not mine his mouth smells sweet but his eyes are locked. (248) we must fill in the gaps ourselves and so become inextricably interwoven into the fabric of the story. we cast around blindly for something with which to fill this awful, haunting passage. morrison does, 57 pages later, finally give it to us as a “sound” (305) which we all recognise, deep down in a part of our “humanity” (mpe 113) beyond the reach of language. --- this sound, which exists within all of us, is kant’s “ding an sich” (kant 34), schopenhauer’s “will to live” (schopenhauer 5) and shakespeare’s pathos extended by common emotion. it is moby-dick and the scarlet letter, and it is indistinguishable from whatever noise leaves kurtz’s lips with his dying breath. conrad expressed it more eloquently than most: “the power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense […] you cannot fail to see the power of mere words […] give me the right word and the right accent and i will move the world” (conrad, a personal record). if we employ language such that it reflects the fundamentally communal nature of sound, the response any call implies, then we can recognise each individual (simultaneously) as someone who experiences, just as ourselves, as well as a part which belongs somewhere in exactly the same symphony of existence as we do. if this is achieved, then meaning-full (and perhaps beautiful) language is the logical result. it is once we understand this that we can appreciate morrison’s closing words, “this is not a story to pass on” (324). this actual story, the one in printed words, is not one to be passed on. the story you read, which encapsulates your entire experience, is what may be passed on, but no longer as a mere story. her work has become a monument precisely because it is not a story. it is something more like a feeling that this world is both far more beautiful and far more terrible than we can imagine. this is why i would term morrison’s language “positive capability”. inherent in it is the ability to realise that knowledge is not singular or definite, without any irritable reaching after generalisation or authoritative discourse. her very language shows that while life may be synonymous with contradiction, it must still be lived, and can only be lived, communally. life, much like beloved, continually escapes our grasp, hampered as we are by the limitations of a language which can only “arc toward the place where meaning may lie” (nobel lecture, 1993). while such an arc can never truly connect experience and perception, we nevertheless must “know it and go on out the yard” (286). welcome home it’s worth returning to the chorus to remember what this is all about: an essay aimed at describing how language can be used to emphasise the community which gives language meaning, thereby overflowing into a lived experience of otherness and belonging; of beloved being both right here, in our heart, and beyond our grasp forever. the modern interconnected world, though, is no longer just about a call-and-response between individuals and the communities to which they belong; but between different communities of meaning, and the way they relate as groups. enter phaswane mpe and the strange second-person narration of welcome to our hillbrow. mpe begins his work between two languages, sepedi and english: > ‘motho ke sera seo fela se rego ge se rakeletšwe se lahle marumo se hlabane ka leleme...’ > a human being is a beast that when cornered throws away weapons and fights with the tongue... > (o k matsepe) > ‘reader, be assured this narrative is no fiction.’ > mmadi, tseba gore kanegelo yekhwi ga se nonwane. > (w e b du bois) the south african writer begins by breaking down the barriers we construct between our different communities and thereby starts, before the text itself, to widen our sense of exactly what a community could include. this theme then runs through the entire novel. phrases like “bone of my heart” (mpe 36) are direct translations of sepedi idioms which require an imaginative leap from english readers to understand and so are used to span across the two languages and reach a greater community. for purely english readers, it requires a level of imaginative involvement to come to terms with the various possibilities of meaning in such a seemingly strange phrase. it is the same level of imaginative involvement morrison’s call generates, and it again points to language that allows for possibility, rather than definition or closure, as the route toward a greater sense of community in language. both texts invoke a strong sense of community – morrison through call-and-response and mpe through the use of second-person narration which draws us inexorably into his story and implicates us at every turn. moreover, both writers resort to passages which approach the lyrical and mpe constantly references different pieces of music throughout his novel (such as the recurring song see the world through the eyes of a child). after the analysis of music in section ii, it should not be surprising that there are also strong links to schopenhauer’s philosophy in welcome to our hillbrow, as well as echoes of the best of the elizabethan writers, especially milton. ultimately, morrison’s language attempts to tell a story that cannot be told in words and so invokes a sense of community through forcing a response from the reader to complete her novel, but this is not quite enough for the conception of language this essay is after. mpe invokes a community through second person narration and then uses language to show just how arbitrary the differences that we construct are, and it is this awareness, inherent in his very words, which can complete the enunciation of our ‘new language’. just as we find in beloved, there is an intense focus on sound in welcome to our hillbrow, although we first encounter it being used in an exclusionary fashion: “makwerekwere was a word derived from kwere kwere, a sound their unintelligible languages were supposed to make, according to the locals” (20). instead of recognising morrison’s fundamental “sound” (beloved 305), the locals label outsiders by virtue of the sound their languages make. mpe uses this to identify the negative impact that language and words can have: > the shocking precision of her words and the determination in her voice had drawn your heart away from tiragalong. (mpe 48) > terror’s words were madness itself. lerato hated him and his words with acid hatred. (67) > she wanted to be laid to rest in our tiragalong, even if it meant exiting this world amidst the ignorant talk of people who turned diseases into crimes. (116 – emphasis added) here, mpe shows how words can come between us and our home, engender hatred, and twist reality to suit the speaker’s “ignorant” (116) point of view. however, he is always at pains to show just how “constructed” (43) and ultimately arbitrary these words and the differences they generate are. such “linguistic chisels” (122) can always be overcome “because tiragalong [is] in hillbrow” (49), and with this realisation comes the knowledge that “home always travels with [us], with [our] consciousness as its vehicle” (55).[^19] if this is so, then we are always a part of a community, because ‘i’ can never be properly at ‘home’ in a solitary sense – ‘home’ requires a sense of belonging which can only ever be achieved relationally. mpe goes on to show how the “makwerekwere” (20) become “mapolantane” (73) who, in turn, become “africans” (102) depending on the context. he says of “mapolantane” (73) that “the word had been stretched and stretched like elastic. it now referred to any black non-south african who was from any african country. mapolantane was a tiragalong equivalent of makwerekwere” (73). such extensions show up the completely arbitrary nature of exclusion. the point here is that if we can stretch words “like elastic” (73) and “graft” (derrida 21) them onto new meanings so as to extend the definition of those excluded by a community, then it follows that we can do the same with our definition of what our own communities include. mpe shows us the power words have to define boundaries; we are left to decide whether we use them to include: “welcome to our hillbrow” (mpe 2 – emphasis added), or exclude “makwerekwere” (20). one of the greatest challenges facing us is that it is easier to use language in an exclusionary fashion. this certainly explains why, in order to start a conversation, all anyone in the j9 group “needed to say was: ah! these english are really strange!” (105) and thereby negatively define themselves as a separate community. one of the fathers of linguistics, ferdinand de saussure, supports this in his claim that “in language there are only differences [...] without positive terms” (course in general linguistics 120). however, he goes on to point out that “the statement that everything in language is negative is true only if the signified and the signifier are considered separately; when we consider the sign in its totality, we have something that is positive in its own class” (120).[^20] it is exactly the recognition of the “positive” possibility contained in language that mpe refers to when he claims that “you had found a mission in all this omission” (mpe 30). he seems to suggest that language must be used in a way which is cognisant, always, of that which it naturally omits. it is thus that we circle back to morrison and the need she feels to “re-memory” (beloved 61) the slaves combined with her “[plea] for that [omitted] wall or that bench or that tower or that tree” (morrison, ‘a bench by the road’). mpe and morrison have the same aim in their writing – to tell the story which has been left out, to make us hear the voices which have been suppressed by making us aware of both our own culpability as well as “our [fundamentally similar] humanity” (mpe 113). “[these are not stories] to pass on” (beloved 324) because stories blithely told always, inevitably, omit. both writers demonstrate the inability of words to describe certain pivotal experiences (as already highlighted). when describing sammy and lerato’s amorous encounter and comparing it to refentše and bohlale’s similar experience, the narrator reminds us that such acts involve “a humanness that could be viewed as human only so long as it remained uncovered by prying eyes and unpublicised by enthusiastic tongues” (50). the point here is that there is some fundamental humanness at the core of each of us which escapes the power of words to describe and is, in fact, destroyed by the attempt.[^21] such a ‘failure’ of language is precisely why morrison and mpe have to develop a sense of community in what could well be viewed as a very roundabout way. any attempt to describe fully the communal sense which they are trying to evoke will destroy that very sense by defining it and therefore making it, at least in some small way, exclusionary. it can only be captured by the common “sound” (beloved 305) which existed before words, to which music is our closest approximation. perhaps this is why we find the song see the world through the eyes of a child echoing through welcome to our hillbrow (mpe 63). children have not yet learnt to construct difference through language – they can only express themselves in the simplest sounds and forms and so are incapable of stripping the “painful and complex realities of humanness” (59) from others. refilwe plays the song for refentše and tells him that she still loves him. she goes on to say: > i wish we could go back to those days of yesteryear. when we were children trying to find our way through the valleys and hills of life. when we could still live without cynicism. when we still had the innocence of children… (87) this is strikingly similar to morrison’s “step back to the beginning [… when there] was the sound, and they all knew what that sound sounded like” (beloved 305). both writers seem to be after a more fundamental mode of expression lost as we grow up and learn how to use words to construct difference and, like terror, to generate hate (mpe 67). moreover, both seem to “arc toward” such expression in beautifully lyrical passages which somehow seem to capture the rhythms of their story more appropriately than any other parts of their novels.[^22] mpe does away with punctuation on a number of occasions and we are presented with fast-paced, rap-like language which captures a certain element of inner city rhythm and way of life. to read these passages is, almost, to experience life itself in hillbrow: > all these things that you have heard seen heard about felt smelt believed disbelieved shirked embraced brewing in your consciousness would find chilling haunting echoes in the simple words… > welcome to our hillbrow… (27) --- > bohlale and the hillbrow child dying as they hit the concrete pavements of johannesburg refilwe rewriting the version of your living and dying tiragalong condemning both of you and the bone of your heart the scarecrow woman of your fiction stifled by the repressive forces of democratisation and hillbrow and tiragalong flowing into each other in your consciousness […] you have heard seen heard about felt smelt believed disbelieved shirked embraced brewing in your consciousness would still find chilling haunting echoes in the simple words… > welcome to our hillbrow… (61-2) we cannot draw breath, cannot escape the emotional attachment mpe wills us to feel, cannot deny the striking resemblance to life such passages evoke because they too do not give us the opportunity to step back and analyse each passing moment. we are drawn in, we become part of this our story and so it is that we come to the realisation that “heaven […] is not some far-off place where god sits in judgement” (47): it is to be found in “the milk, honey and bile regions of [our] own expanding brain” (79) and is, finally, “the world of our continuing existence located in the memory and consciousness of those who live with us and after us” (124). it is here that the link back to schopenhauer can be seen clearly, for his collective “will to live [which] lies at the foundation of all explanations [and is] the kernel of reality itself” (schopenhauer 6) leads us to the conclusion that: > individuals are fleeting as the water in a brook; the idea, on the contrary, is permanent [… and so] the will shows itself to us as something toto genere different from the representation. (6) mpe’s “hillbrow of milk and honey and bile, all brewing in the depths of our collective consciousness” (41) or “heaven [which] is the world of our continuing existence, located in the memory and consciousness of those who live with us and after us” (124) strangely echoes schopenhauer’s the world as will and representation, published one hundred and eighty-three years prior. > what frustrated her so much was the extent to which publishing was in many ways out of touch with the language and events of everyday life. > it was a very different story with other creative forms; music for instance. (94) the individual’s relative insignificance in the greater scheme of events is nowhere more evident than when mpe reminds the reader that “such laudatory noises appeared forgetful of the fact that mandela was not the only player in this game of politics” (100) – as stark a statement of the importance of community over the individual as a south african writer could perhaps ever make. ultimately, it is only when we acknowledge that “i do not own life” (67) that we can come to a realisation of how fundamentally similar we all are. this lack of individual possession leads to empathy and understanding which extend to something as extraordinarily complicated as > the choice between suicide and life [which] was not merely a choice between stupidity and intelligence, [because] sometimes, when people threw their own life away, it was because they were intelligent and courageous enough to see and admit that they did not own this life. (117) this, finally, completes our great circle and brings us back to the elizabethans for whom the notion of owning life would have been nonsensical. elizabethan echoes abound in welcome to our hillbrow: > this heaven that is your present abode is a very different thing. it carries within it its own hell. (47) > god and the gods of our happiness […] lived in the skulls and hearts of the people. (111) both of which share the same sentiment as those most famous lines from milton’s epic poem: > […] then wilt thou not be loth > to leave this paradise, but shalt possess > a paradise within thee, happier far. > paradise lost, xii, 585-7 milton, morrison, mpe: all of them highlight in their own ways the fact that true happiness is only to be found by reaching an internal peace with one’s self. with the elizabethan poet, this is achieved through subservience and obeying the will of god. lacking such divine direction three hundred and thirty-four years later, mpe shows us that such happiness can be achieved through an acknowledgement of the “many-sidedness of life” (95) which allows us to build communities without destroying the “humanness” (59) of others with “ignorant talk” (116). old words anew we require a language which - at every turn - makes us aware of and draws us into the community which gives it meaning. we can take the theoretical approach and quote people like mikhael bakhtin, who conceives of language in his the dialogic imagination: > not as a system of abstract grammatical categories, but rather […] as ideologically saturated, as a world view, even as a concrete opinion ensuring a maximum of mutual understanding in all spheres of ideological life. thus a unitary language gives expression to forces working towards concrete verbal and ideological unification and centralization, which develop in vital connection with the processes of socio-political and cultural centralization. (bakhtin 271) or, more succinctly (and under his adopted pseudonym): > i give myself verbal shape from another’s point of view, ultimately, from the point of view of the community to which i belong. a word is a bridge thrown between myself and another [...] a word is territory shared by both addresser and addressee, by the speaker and his interlocutor. (voloshinov 86) however, it is still necessary to extend bakhtin’s “bridge” (271) with a more modern metaphor. morrison and mpe point toward an entire community within their language and do so using imagery and narrative technique far less definite and definitive than a bridge which can only ever connect two, well-defined points. our language needs to invoke more than merely “addresser and addressee” (voloshinov 86). our language needs to be the equivalent of a wireless link, sent out into the world so that anyone who wishes to receive it need only connect to the network, which can support a myriad of concurrent connections if one sets it up to do so. furthermore, when the narrator of welcome to our hillbrow describes why refilwe is so taken with refentše’s short story, he says that it is “because it made her see herself and her own prejudices in a different light” (mpe 96). this should be the aim of our language beyond merely inciting a community which all texts can, to some extent, be said to do. our language must carry within its very structure an awareness of its prejudices, of the manner in which it excludes and does violence to that to which it gives expression. this is not to say that the individual must be entirely done away with, she must simply be removed from the centre of our conception of language and therefore from the centre of our socio-political and cultural ideology. samuel barondes puts it thus: > each of us is ordinary, yet one of a kind. each of us is standard issue, conceived by the union of two germ cells, nurtured in the womb, and equipped with a developmental program that guides our further maturation and eventual decline. > each of us is also unique, the possessor of a particular selection of gene variants from the collective [cf. schopenhauer] human genome and immersed in a particularly family, culture, era and peer group. with inborn tools for adaptation to the circumstances of our personal world, we keep building our own ways of being [cf. mpe] and the sense of who we are. […] > recognizing how much we share with others promotes compassion, humility, respect and brotherhood [cf. morrison]. recognizing that we are each unique promotes pride, self-development, creativity [cf. shakespeare] and achievement. (barondes 32)[^23] language put in service of expressing our unicity is exactly that which can make the definitions of community as malleable as the meanings of words. the clue is in the language itself[^24]: “unicity” means both ‘the fact or quality of being unique’, and ‘the fact of being or consisting of one, or of being united as a whole’. barondes' words emphasise that the individual should not be entirely forgotten, lest we wish to lose the creativity that inspired shakespeare, milton, marlowe, morrison, melville and mpe to write what they did in the first place. consilience arguably the most important moment in welcome to our hillbrow occurs when refilwe finally approaches “the-stranger-who-is-not-a-stranger [in] jude the obscure” (mpe 109-10).[^25] the moment is narrated thus: “she did come closer. she dared to start a conversation. she complicated her life” (111). mpe shows us that no stranger is truly and absolutely strange to us. such understanding is not necessarily straightforward, but we must complicate our lives if we are to ever overcome the simplistic, authoritative, oppositional and individualised discourses which seem to dominate modern thought. furthermore, mpe’s intertextual references to texts like thomas hardy’s jude the obscure and zakes mda’s ways of dying (109) are yet another way in which he invokes a sense of community that extends beyond the confines of his own text. just as he extends the idea of text beyond his own work with such references, mpe makes us see that “tiragalong was in hillbrow” (49) or “in johannesburg” (79) or indeed that “hillbrow” (2), “alexandra” (79), “johannesburg” (79), “england” (97), “all” (104), “humanity” (113), and “heaven” (124) are, ultimately, one and the same thing. we just need to use language in a way which reflects this fact. schopenhauer’s will is “independent of all knowledge” (7), shakespeare shows us that “there are more things in heaven and earth […]/ than are dreamt of in our philosophy” (hamlet, i, v.174-5), morrison writes of an indeterminate “sound” (beloved 305) which existed before words and is common to all, and mpe highlights the power arbitrary definitions have to enclose or extend communities. all are after some unnameable thing which unites humanity beyond the bounds of definition. however, precisely because it is beyond arbitrary definitions based on context, because definition is the one and only thing it lacks, it must finally escape ‘my’ power to enunciate fully. herein lies the beauty, and the frustration, of this conception of language: we can only ever strive to “come closer.

[^2]: virginia woolf sums it up neatly: “the worst of it is that in the shadow of the letter ‘i’ all is shapeless as mist [...] ‘i am bored!’ but why was i bored? partly because of the dominance of the letter ‘i’ and the aridity, which, like the giant beech tree, it casts within its shade. nothing will grow there” (a room of one’s own 144-5) [^3]: this is another idea supported by blanchot, for to illuminate the “other night” (171) is to make it precisely that which it is not, and is thus to do violence to it, to de-form it. [^4]: the “other night” exists only as an other, to include it within a system of representation is to make it into something it is not, or perhaps one should rather say that it is to make it into some thing. however, if we acknowledge and recognisemccaffery this fact, we can allow it to continue to exist as other and so act on the discourse which acts on us. in other words, we can assert the agency necessary for creativity etc. while still remaining within a communal system of representation, in this case, language. i include references to hawthorne and melville because these two writers, in particular, would have understood the possibility for meaning inherent in the interplay of “différance” (derrida 18) between different narrative layers, mixed descriptions of the “actual and the imaginary” (hawthorne 26), and different characters (ahab, ishmael and queequeg) had the frenchman theorised about signatures, events and contexts a century before he did. [^5]: “positive capability” is a term i explain in detail later in this essay. it is derived from keats’ “negative capability” (keats, letter 21 dec, 1817) with the difference that it recognises the possibility of creating a sense of community and hence greater understanding and meaning through language. [^6]: in the work of authors like j. m. coetzee, we see that it is this construction of difference upon which we build our sense of identity as in, for instance, dusklands, where jacobus coetzee discusses the differences between his conceptions of his own people versus the hottentots (coetzee 61). [^7]: a point made by, and agreed upon by most critics since the father of modern semiotics and linguistics; ferdinand de saussure in the course on general linguistics. [^8]: the saying apocryphally attributed to samuel beckett: “i say i, disbelievingly”, is here illustrative of my point. there is a part of all of us beyond the reach of any language, be it our own or the community’s, to describe. [^9]: instances of these abound in the text, the most oft-occurring being “bone-of-my-heart” (17) to describe a lover and various other idiomatic representations of “homeboy[s]” and “homegirl[s]” (64) etc. [^10]: and, true to sterne himself (i hope) in that it might be of great use in understanding the final product. nor is this the only similarity i wish there to be between the two texts. sterne was able to challenge, through the clever and careful use of language, an entire world view predominant at the time of his life, namely realism and the other forms of determinism that went with it. this, to my mind, proves the power of language, and it is one which i wish to harness in support of my, far more academic and far less entertaining, argument for a language which fundamentally challenges the individual-as-centre and resulting materialistic world view i see as predominant in my own lifetime. [^11]: i hope that a tracked change proving the “citationality” and “iterability” (7) of derrida’s argument in “signature, event, context” is appropriately meta-textual for an essay about language. (of course, tracked changes don't translate from gdocs to markdown, but i'll let you use your imagination here.) also, much like derrida’s equivocal writing reflects the nature and content of his argument, i hope that the number and length of footnotes provides a complex, multiple, simultaneous understanding of this argument. [^12]: even in milton, perhaps one of the strictest adherents to a hierarchical world-view, we find this to be a most central concept: “a paradise within thee, happier far” (paradise lost, xii, 587). bertrand russell has this to say: \"philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes our mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind is also rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good\". even if you disagree about how good elizabethan writing is, the point remains that it is in considering that which is greater than merely ourselves (something not done by many modern individuals convinced of god’s death) which makes us greater, whether it’s a long golden chain, a great symphony or god himself. [^13]: see werner heisenberg’s (in)famous uncertainty principle and albert einstein’s general theory of relativity. [^14]: what is the function of a monument? a monument memorialises individuals who should be remembered by printing their names on a plaque, but this is always subsumed by the monument itself, of which an individual’s name is but a small part. it will, for instance, show american troops capturing iwo jima, but the point is that this depiction is not of individual troops – it is of a communal success (or failure) and advancement of ideology (another good example of this would be the voortrekker monument). nothing, to my mind, could be more symbolic of schopenhauer’s “will to live” (schopenhauer 5) which, while experienced by the individual, exceeds notions of individuality. [^15]: that is, we travel with sethe through the healing processes of repression, painful reconciliation and, finally, some peace, although never a fully-realised one. [^16]: smitherman defines call-and-response as “spontaneous verbal and non-verbal interaction between speaker and listener in which all of the statements (‘calls’) are punctuated by expressions (‘responses’) from the listener” (104). she suggests that responses function to affirm or agree with the speaker, urge the speaker on, repeat what the speaker has said, complete the speaker’s statement in response to a request from the speaker or in spontaneous talking with the speaker, or indicate extremely powerful affirmation of what the speaker has said. this affirmatory role is an important element of morrison’s work, because our (affirming) responses further complicate any moral or ethical judgement of sethe and/or beloved. linda krumholz speaks extensively about the relationship between african-american music and traditions of call-and-response in her essay “the ghosts of slavery: historical recovery in toni morrison’s beloved”. [^17]: see 254-6 for this entire passage. also see 95-6 for an actual song that appears in the novel. there are numerous other passages one can find on even the barest inspection. [^18]: moreover, i would argue that one should do so in a way that attempts to uncover “what of each is fundamental, what is enduring and essential – their one illuminating and convincing quality – the very truth of their existence” (conrad 145). [^19]: already, we see schopenhauer’s “all that we know lies within consciousness” (schopenhauer, 2), but this point will be developed fully later on in this section. [^20]: “signifier” and “signified” (de saussure 67) are the two terms de saussure uses to denote what he calls the “sound-image” (66) and the “concept” (66). the sound-image is “not the material sound, a purely physical thing, but the psychological imprint of the sound, the impression that it makes on our senses. the sound-image is sensory, and if i happen to call it \"material,\" it is only in that sense, and by way of opposing it to the other term of the association, the concept, which is generally more abstract” (66). [^21]: again, we find a link with blanchot’s “orpheus’s gaze”, but this time, eurydice is that indefinable part of self which makes community, responsibility and hospitality such important terms through ensuring that we can never fully know an other human being. [^22]: although perhaps with slightly different intention, léopold senghor has this to say of rhythm: “it is the thing that is most perceptible and least material. it is the archetype of the vital element. it is the first condition and the hallmark of art, as breath is of life: breath, which accelerates or slows, which becomes even or agitated according to the tension in the individual, the degree and the nature of his emotion. this is rhythm in its primordial purity; this is rhythm in the masterpieces of negro art, especially sculpture. it is composed of a theme—sculptural form—which is set in opposition to a sister theme, as inhalation is to exhalation, and that is repeated. it is not the kind of symmetry that gives rise to monotony; rhythm is alive, it is free. . . . this is how rhythm affects what is least intellectual in us, tyrannically, to make us penetrate to the spirituality of the object; and that character of abandon which is ours is itself rhythmic.” for a further sense of how interlinked all this is, merely consider the degree to which exactly the same sort of breath, the spirit and life are constantly equated in shakespeare. [^23]: barondes is, interestingly enough, director of the center [sic] for neurobiology & psychiatry at the university of california – san francisco and author of making sense of people: decoding the mysteries of personality. i use him here specifically to show how our language need not be confined to literature; it must be used in all spheres of life if it is to have any meaningful impact. [^24]: a point aldous huxley makes, over and over, in the perennial philosophy which is, unfortunately, out of scope here. [^25]: it is no mistake that mpe chooses this text for one of his most central intertextual references. unlike hardy’s novel, which is deeply cynical and argues, essentially, that man is alone and that society is violent and harmful to individuals, mpe uses the name to create an opportunity for refilwe and “the-stranger-who-was-not-a-stranger” (mpe 110) to meet. [^26]: this is a psychological term taken from daniel kahneman’s thinking, fast and slow and essentially refers to an object or some other cue which makes one (subconsciously) predisposed to a certain reaction. for interest’s sake, in one experiment, kahneman describes how subjects, ‘primed’ to think of money (via a pile of dollars left on the table or a dollar screensaver shown on a computer), were less likely to help experimenters pick up pencils they specifically dropped on entering the room. similarly, if asked to set up the room for an interview after again being primed to think of money, the subjects would set up the chairs for themselves and the interviewer further apart. i mention this here because i believe it goes to the necessity for a communal conception of language in a modern, materialistic world where we are so often encouraged to act individually, sometimes without our even being consciously aware of it."

    "content": "playing with time: milton's satan, similes and subversions section i one of the enduring mysteries of milton’s grand epic “paradise lost” is the range of criticism, complimentary and otherwise, it has generated over the centuries. the poem has sparked an almost unique reaction in every different generation of readers who have braved milton’s grand style and mind-twisting grammar. the obvious example of the same character giving rise to varying interpretations, quite poles apart, is satan. for romantic readers like blake and shelley, satan was milton’s epic hero (intended or not) hence the claim; “milton’s devil as a moral being is far superior to his god” (shelley, 63). the eminent victorian critic, sir walter raleigh, contends that “satan unavoidably reminds us of prometheus… his very situation as the fearless antagonist of omnipotence makes him either a fool or a hero and milton is far from permitting us to think him a fool” (raleigh, 133). for a modern reader this view has been combated fairly effectively by c.s. lewis in his a preface to paradise lost, wherein he makes the distinction between believing satan to be a magnificent poetical achievement worthy of the reader’s admiration and thinking him a magnificent character in and of himself. satan, for lewis, “becomes more a lie than a liar; a personified self-contradiction” (lewis, 94) what is baffling is that two admittedly great literary personages of lewis and shelley might arrive at views so incredibly different. is it possible that satan was somehow a different character in blake and shelley’s time? what is more is that lewis has by no means won the debate about satan or the value and greatness of milton’s poetry with critics of the poem post-1940. a.j. waldock has this to say: > there is hardly a great speech of satan’s that milton is not at pains to correct, to damp down and neutralize. he will put some glorious thing in satan’s mouth, then anxious about the effect of it, will pull us gently by the sleeve (for this is what it amounts to) : ‘do not be carried away by this fellow : he sounds splendid, but take my word for it…’ has there been much despair in what we have been listening to? the speech would almost seem to be incompatible with that. waldock, 77 we might, at first, be inclined to agree with waldock if we consider satan in book i. he does indeed sound glorious, and milton does indeed check him just after his speech: > irreconcileable, to our grand foe, > who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy > sole reigning holds the tyranny of heav’n. > so spake the apostate angel, though in pain > vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despair > book i, ll. 123-6 satan here has elements of milton’s own utterances in areopagitica, berating censorship of any kind and championing the individual will, virtuous because ‘purified’ by trial. the narrative voice at the end does seem contradictory; where in the preceding speech does satan show any signs of despair? there seems to be even more evidence in waldock’s favour if we consider the debate in pandæmonium in book ii where each devil is given his say only to be rebuked by the narrative voice after his speech. moloch “… ended frowning, and his look denounc’d/ desperate revenge” (book ii, 106-7). belial, whose words are only “cloath’d in reasons garb/ counsell’d ignoble ease and peaceful sloth/ not peace” (book ii, 226-8) is veritably taunted by the narrative voice. mammon receives great applause, but this is only because, for the devils, “another such field/ they dreaded worse than hell: so much the fear/ of thunder and the sword of michael/ wrought still within them” (book ii, 292-5) and beelzebub can only “[plead] his devilish counsel, first devis’d/ by satan” (book ii, 379-80) even though “satan except, none higher sat” (book ii, 300). these narrative retorts to some of the most grandiloquent political language in the poem (book ii, 164, 185, 199-225, 230-7, 254, 310-2) and perhaps the entire language, do admittedly seem out of place. however, my argument is that the speech does not “seem” (waldock, 77) to be incompatible with the narrative rebuke at the end of it; it very much is incompatible with it. moreover, milton isn’t pulling “us gently by the sleeve” (waldock, 77); he is doing exactly what i have suggested – rebuking us. it is the equivalent of a literary slap in the face. milton is not politely warning us, but accusing, taunting us with an imperious narrative voice which says “i know that you have already been carried away by what has been said. i knew you would be, even though you should not have been. you have made a mistake because you are fallen.” the invitation is to recognise your fallen nature because this will lead you to a full understanding of milton’s message at the end of the poem; although fallen, there is nevertheless the possibility of “a paradise within thee, happier farr” (book xii, 587). waldock’s insistence that the epic voice and preceding speech “must agree” (waldock, 78), stems from a modern preference for showing over telling, illustrated by wayne c. booth. this preference is particularly out of place in the epic genre, as this necessarily requires the guiding persona of the poet and his epic voice. the complexity of the devils’ speeches is only apparent when the reader has been led to discovering them by the necessity of having to account for the difference between reading experience and what milton’s narrative voice is saying. on noticing such complexity, it’s obvious that milton isn’t correcting a mistake of his own composition, but is pointing to the weakness all men tend to show in the face of demonic eloquence. waldock is wrong to think that the narrative rebuke somehow scrubs our minds of satan’s or the devils’ “glorious utterances, heroic demeanour and impressive wilfulness” (raleigh, 5). in actuality, it sets up a dramatic conflict between the immediate context of what is being said and the larger, cosmic context of the epic situation. it is a conflict analogous to the difference between satan’s inner despair and outer vainglorious, boastful and arrogant demeanour. however, if we consider this closely, the analogy is inverted, as it is satan’s inner state which correlates to the larger, cosmic context that milton was working in. this is not surprising, given milton’s constant reminders of hell (and paradise, as above) as not just physically realisable places, but psychological states of being: > the hell within him, for within him hell > he brings, and round about him, nor from hell > one step no more than from himself can fly > by change of place > book iv, ll. 18-23 it is at this point that milton begins to “play” with the reader. i do not mean this in the sense of a child on a playground, but rather in that age-old dictum milton would have known all too well; docere et delectare. milton’s poem suggests that our internal state is related to the cosmos, which we can alter according to our free will and through our relationships with others, although god has foreknowledge of all futures and essentially exerts his authority through his mere existence. this is a point i feel waldock misses entirely; one of milton’s major concerns is with relationships; how we relate to god, the son and the angels (both as fallen and unfallen beings), how we relate to satan and him to us, how satan relates to god, how satan relates to himself, how we relate to adam and eve and how the way that they relate to each other sheds light on human relationships in general. it is these relationships milton uses to delight and teach the reader as he is drawn along by the poet’s unique grammar and epic, grand style. waldock does not see that these relationships shed light on some of the vital and most engaging speeches in the poem, such as eve and adam to each other (book ix, 205-25, 227-69) and satan to eve (book ix, 679-732). in fact, he misses completely the central relationship milton is concerned with; that of the poem with the reader. i would argue that the poem’s centre of reference is the reader, as it is to the reader that milton wants to “justify the wayes of god” (book i, 26). more than this though, paradise lost is written for “the honor and instruction of [milton’s] country… [for the] adorning of [his] native tongue… [and] to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest things among mine own citizens” (milton, ‘the reason of church government’, emphasis added). in other words, milton has a specific purpose in writing his epic; he wants to educate his reader into a knowledge and then acceptance of their position and responsibilities as a fallen being. milton achieves this by recreating the effects of the fall in the mind of each reader, which is arguably the poem’s final ‘scene’. we must believe satan entirely if we are to learn how to see through his lies. if we did not see them as true first (or as holding some truth), we could not realise, and thus overcome, the power of satanic eloquence; precisely the reason for eve’s fall – her being “mindless” (book ix, 431). the poem’s relationship with the reader goes deeper than this though, for we often forget that the seventeenth century reader was a very different man to the modern one. milton, fortunately, lived on the edge of douglas bush’s “scientific movement” (bush, 37) which divorced cosmic principles from human relationships and interaction. this shattered what e.m.w. tillyard describes as the “chain of being” (tillyard, 37); an object that was thought to both distinguish and unite all modes of existence from rocks, through plants and animals, to humans, angels and god. as such, milton could make the most of the “medieval allegorical instinct”, which bush describes as arising from “the simultaneous embracing of different planes of knowledge and experience or the habit of immediate and almost unconscious transition from one to another” (bush, 38). the transition from satan’s voice to narrative rebuke is perhaps the most prominent example of milton mixing different cosmic planes of knowledge and experience to induce a specific effect (that of the recognition of one’s own fallen nature) in order to achieve a specific purpose (educate the reader so that he can regain a paradise within himself). section ii the characters of satan and the devils may be the most widely discussed and criticised of milton’s attempts to educate the reader while writing a national epic, but they are not his only mechanism. epic simile is an important part of the epic genre, used specifically in an attempt to place people and things, perceived in one time and place, in the larger perspective from which their significance can be determined. this presents an obvious problem for milton though, for the story he is telling is not one that exists fully in time and space. we cannot think of god or of the story of creation as happening at a given time or place, as both of these notions are premised on the act of creation itself. milton’s similes may therefore be seen as a solution to an apparently unsolvable problem; by refusing to allow the reader to perceive a firm notion of time and space initially, milton can widen the scope of the poem to include the entire cosmos without contradicting himself. let us consider one of the first epic similes we encounter in the poem: > his spear, to equal which the tallest pine > hewn on norwegian hills, to be the mast > of some great admiral, were but a wand > book i, ll. 292-4 if re-read slowly, this does make sense; and we can construct a statement of relative magnitudes; “spear is to pine as pine is to wand”, but this is not what the reading experience is truly like. due to milton’s grammar, this experience tells us is that were one to compare his spear to a pine, the comparison would be inadequate. milton is mixing scales; if he allowed the association with the pine to stand it would have been inadequate, as satan is a higher dimensional being, and so his ‘size’ cannot be understood in human terms. if he had merely said that the spear is larger than one can imagine, he would have lost the concreteness that is vital to any effective image. we cannot simultaneously imagine a pine and a wand while comparing both to a third object, and so milton is able to suggest a reality beyond our own by forcing the reader, dramatically, to feel its unavailability. within lines of this, milton produces what is arguably the finest epic simile in english literature: > his legions, angel forms, who lay intrans’t > thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks > in vallombrosa… > book i, ll. 299-301 milton moves from “angel forms” to leaves to sedge to “busiris and his memphian chivalry” (book i, 307). the compression of images here is so densely intermingled with different time frames that it almost defies analysis. the fallen angels (who are like pharaoh and his cavalry in that they are in a lake, beaten by god) are as numberless as autumnal leaves and are scattered (like pharaoh) as easily as sedge. both are already pursuing “the sojourners of goshen” (book i, 309) which can be taken to mean, quite literally, the israelites – as well as adam and eve – and hence, by milton’s interconnected world, the reader. attempting to unravel a chronological time frame proves impossible; milton has moved from outside conceptions of time, to recorded human history to the reader’s present and back again in 12 lines of poetry. furthermore, we are made to feel the shifts inessential, carried along by words like “vallombrosa”, which stress the image above all else. conceptions of time are shattered by milton’s style, grammar and palpably aural techniques. one need just roll “vallombrosa” on the tongue to be transported to a paradise where time is truly of no concern. between these two similes, we find one of milton’s many references to the “tuscan artist” (book i, 288) galileo galilei, whose “glazed optic tube” (book iii, 590) could well represent the limits of human knowledge in milton’s time. however, even the references to astronomers bear great ambiguity. adam asks raphael for an explanation of planetary movement in book viii, and is replied to thus: > … how gird the sphear > with centric and eccentric scribl’d o’re, > cycle and epicycle, orb in orb > book viii, ll. 82-4 > the planet earth, so stedfast though she seem, > insensibly three different motions move? > book viii, ll. 129-30 the greatest shock for a modern reader, besides the fact that milton is mixing two theories about space, is that the speech is finished off with another narrative intrusion: “to whom thus adam cleerd of doubt, repli’d” (book viii, 179). cleared of doubt? this seems dubious at best. how is it possible that such a convoluted explanation which mixes two clearly different world-views clears adam of doubt? what is more is that milton actually anticipates this reaction in the argument to book viii; “adam enquires concerning celestial motions, is doubtfully answered”. one answer to this question has already been hinted at in the discussion of satan above. only by forcing upon the reader an awareness of his limited perspective can milton provide a negative intuition of what another perspective may be like. the reasoning may seem circular, but this is a direct consequence of the poem’s subject matter; it is the story of creation and, as such, still creates the responses of its reader and (for milton) all readers. the fact is that adam is cleared of doubt only because he is unfallen and thus knows that the knowledge offered to him by rafael is all that he needs to know; other things remain rightly out of reach of his understanding as a man. by making sure we doubt where adam does not, milton makes us aware of the gap between ourselves and adam. we are made to feel palpably the result of the fall by the clearly outrageous comment of the narrative voice which is just as clearly true. if we can find our way through this juxtaposition, we can come to fully appreciate adam’s words in book xii: > greatly instructed i shall hence depart, > greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill > of knowledge, what this vessel can containe. > book xii, ll. 557-90 milton seems to suggest that there is some knowledge that cannot be contained in earthly vessels, which are bound, by their very nature, to earthly dimensions. section iii such dimensions include time, which has always been a topic of much debate for scientists and philosophers. milton unsettles the reading experience with truly epic shifts in time. the most obvious of these is michael taking adam on a run through of most of human history in books xi and xii. however, we are met with discrepancies in time much earlier on, in fact, as early as the first page. we are told that “nine times the space that measures day and night” (book i, 50) is the distance satan fell from heaven. while this may be taken from greek myth, the ambiguity about quite what or who is doing the measuring is clearly miltonic. can space measure? if so, how long is a day and is it longer or shorter than a night? can day and night be spatial at all? milton, in many ways, was a couple of hundred years ahead of einstein, for this is surely analogous to the spacetime of einstein’s general relativity. einstein linked space and time through hyperbolic, four dimensional geometry in minkowski spacetime. milton’s relativity is, in many ways, far easier to understand than einstein’s and has one major advantage over it. milton’s relativity relates all things under the static chain of being, which can nevertheless be traversed by the use of free will to move higher up or further down relative to the absolute of god (tillyard, 45). this fact alone allows milton to extrapolate relationships between every one of his epic characters and the reader and draw at least some conclusions, through the use of his epic voice, not available to einstein. one might say milton’s is a vertical relativity bounded by god while einstein’s is horizontal and exists only in the limit of human knowledge. consider the start of book ix; we begin in an indeterminate time where milton tells us he “must change/ those notes to tragic” (book ix, 6) and justifies why. we then find we are back with satan (book ix, 53), circling the earth “from pole to pole” (book ix, 66). we are also back to the end of book iv, where we left satan for raphael and adam’s visit which lasts the better part of four books. milton then posits his explanation for our inability to understand god and his angels in entirely human terms; “there was a place,/ now not, though sin, not time, first wraught the change” (book ix, 69-70). note how ‘time’, sandwiched in between two caesuras, breaks the flow of the sentence and hence disrupts our understanding of what milton is saying as we read. milton is again using his grammar to both play with the reader as well as make a serious point about how our concept of linear, chronological time hampers our understanding of things which necessarily exist outside of conceptual experience. by placing ‘sin’ before ‘time’ he also makes the reader painfully aware of the very human cause (and thus nature) of this problem. milton is continually turning the reading experience back on the reader; teaching him while delighting him through an almost numberless array of structural, grammatical, stylistic inversions and twists. these force the reader to acknowledge his fallen nature while making sure that he too comes to the same conclusion as milton does; there is indeed the possibility of “a paradise within thee, happier farr” (book xii, 587) to be reached by faith in the redeeming power of the son. milton’s epic voice is perhaps more prevalent and demanding than other epic voices, but this should be seen as a result of the specific purpose milton had in writing a national epic. he never allows the reader to settle in a time or place or to think about extra-dimensional beings in only one way, or through only one image. his use of contradictory images and systems (which are still fundamentally related in the cosmic background of the work) to illustrate and place his poem in time and space, serve to make the scale and scope truly infinite by refusing to fix any one point in absolute relation to any other. as soon as we believe belial, we are rebuked into remembering that his words are only “… cloath’d in reasons garb”; as soon as we think we can picture satan, we are told that what we had in mind is “but a wand” (book i, 294) to the actual reality of the “apostate angel” (book i, 125). the fallen angels as “autumnal leaves” (book i, 299-311) is probably the most famous example of the sort of intermingled notions of myth, knowledge, time, place and space that constitutes the miltonic world. milton, in all his brilliance, is able to structure his very language and form so that any comment on the poem is, through the fundamental relationship of poem to reader, equally a comment on the reader himself. works cited booth, wayne c. the rhetoric of fiction. chicago. penguin books, 1961. bush, douglas. the earlier seventeenth century. oxford. oxford university press. from dept. english ru handout, pg. 4-5. forsyth, mark. the etymologicon. london. icon books ltd. 2011 (page 15) keats, john. “ode on a grecian urn”. 5 verses. @ 13 october2012. lewis, clive staples. a preface to paradise lost. oxford. oxford university press, 1942. milton, john. areopagitica. dept. english ru handout, pg. 7. milton, john. “the reason of church government”. dept. english ru handout, pg. 6. milton, john. paradise lost, ed. barbara lewalski. oxford. blackwell publishing, 2007.

    "content": "yours sincerely: truth, singularity, and ontological designing in white south african nonfiction supervisor: dr michelle kelly the university of oxford mst world literature in english june 2015 words: 11026 “i walked my love on the night green side of it and cried my heart to the eastbound cars and cried my heart to the westbound cars and took my truth across a small humped bridge and hurried my truth, the charm of it, home and hoarded these constants into morning only to find them gone.” — just once, anne sexton setting the stage > “one must begin by recognizing the lack of any transcendent, absolute, archimedean point from which to judge the authentic from the inauthentic, the sincere from the manipulative, truth from ideology” (adam kelly, “new sincerity”, 2010: 137-8) “here is truth telling at its most courageous and exemplary” claims the front-cover of my traitor’s heart (vintage, 1990). however, if – as kelly claims – one can never tell the sincere from the manipulative, then are ways of writing which are advertised as the ‘truth’ to be read sincerely or suspiciously? if there is no way of separating ‘truth’ from the performance of truth, then what warrants the description ‘exemplary and courageous’ and why do critics like hedley twidle emphasise the “current success of nonfiction in south africa” (“in a place”, 2012: 6)? nonfiction makes its primary truth-claims via marketing which places it in a specific, verifiable ‘reality’. as salman rushdie says in his short introductory note: > “the book rian malan set out to write is altogether more conventional than the one he has written […] along the way, he ran into, and faced up to, the truth that is the making of his book […] that he could only write about the atrocity of south africa by admitting the atrocity hidden in his own traitorous heart.” in other words, though nonfiction is advertised as being about ‘reality’, one can only express the ‘truth’ by performing one’s own role in creating that ‘truth’. the ‘reality’ of nonfiction is revealed by showing how the ‘truth’ depends on the reader’s belief in such admissions of treachery and their awareness of the way ‘reality’ is inevitably manipulated in order to represent unconventional and traitorous – yet affective and self-conscious – ‘truths’. david shields argues that the desire to break “larger and larger chunks of ‘reality’” into artistic works is, in fact, common to “a burgeoning group of interrelated but unconnected artists in a multitude of forms and media” (reality hunger, 2010: 3). shields claims this ‘reality hunger’ to be present in almost any artistic movement, arguing that modern readers are both “desperate for authenticity and in love with artifice, they know all the moments are ‘moments’: staged and theatrical, shaped and thematized” (5). importantly, shields’ “antigenre […] relies on viewer awareness of the creator’s self-conscious, wobbly manipulation of the gap between person and persona” (4). my focus in this essay will therefore be on the ways in which the gaps between person and persona and ‘truth’ and its performance are manipulated, as well as how – even as performances – such manipulative moments might be read sincerely so as to grasp at “something more than truthfulness” (midlands, 2002: x), something describable only in terms of derek attridge’s concept of “singularity” (2014). rian malan’s my traitor’s heart, antjie krog’s country of my skull (1998), and jonny steinberg’s the number (2004) all rely on similar kinds of self-conscious address and manipulation, beginning with malan’s very first words: ““i’m burned out and starving to death, so i’m just going to lay this all on you and trust that you’re a visionary reader” (heart, 13). each work exhibits what shields calls “plasticity of form” (reality, 5), moving between narrative voices and different modes of address to reveal a deep concern with the acts of interpretation, translation, speaking, and listening between black and white, english and afrikaans, afrikaans and zulu, and so on. self-conscious, if wobbly, manipulation of the gap between person and persona relies on what adam kelly calls a “logic of anticipation” (“sincerity”, 136). he explains that “the anticipation of others’ reception of one’s outward behaviour […] begins to take priority for the acting self, so that inner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic” (136). in other words, how we expect others to react becomes the originating cause of how we present ourselves, which can be read either as deeply narcissistic, or as a sincere attempt to engender a different kind of responsibility. it all depends on what the reader chooses to make of the performance. kelly describes anticipation as that which morphs “divisions between self and other […] into conflicts with the self, and a recursive and paranoid cycle of endless anticipation begins, putting in doubt the very referents […] ‘self’ and ‘other’, ‘inner’ and outer’” (“sincerity”, 136). steinberg’s work, grounded as it is in his methods of ethnographic research, seems most concerned with conflicts between the self and how these relate to an external world shared with others. he returns time and again to the problems of narrating anyone’s story but one’s own: > i shut up. the subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the ‘i’ up. but he had, of course, told the ‘i’ precisely what every ‘i’ wants to hear. he had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. the victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (the number, 242) each sentence adapts the claims of the last, and the shifts from i to ‘i’, to he and ‘i’, to he and me, clearly stage the ways in which it is possible to manipulate the gap between person and persona, which shields claims to be a definitive feature of reality hungry art. steinberg seems well aware that for a white man to declare he can write a story concerned with the lived experiences of ‘south africans’ in general is highly suspicious: “i am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and i am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. i announce up front that i will not tell you how the material was gathered” (midlands, 2002: 218). given that the last sentence takes the form of an announcement, this too can be read as fundamentally performative, but it is a performance which steinberg insists is based upon research and various ‘gathered materials’. if we lay aside for a moment the “hermeneutics of suspicion” (“sincerity”, 140) which kelly argues gloss over the “truly valuable in human life […] love, trust, faith and responsibility” (135), is it not possible to make performances like this ‘true’ in so far as the reader believes in them, knowing the writer to be as ‘anxious’ about such an extension of trust as they are? furthermore, the fact that steinberg is designing texts in which the ‘colour of his skin’, the ‘failure of his predecessors’ and the fact that he deliberately withholds information, paradoxically, seems to add to the truth-value of the work, means the question becomes not just one of reading sincerely and believing the performance, but how we might actively design the ways we read and write to include ‘the truly valuable in human life’, rather than hoping for malan’s ‘visionary reader’ and reading suspiciously. ‘love, trust, faith and responsibility’ seems to be most affectively expressed in the self-conscious manipulation of the gap between person and persona, yet there remains something deeply artificial, something staged, about the ways in which all three writers are able to interact with and interpret the “irreconcilable realities”, or “separate psychic trenches” (heart, 412) of south africa and her people. however, as shields argues, ‘reality hungry’ art negotiates paradoxes like this with elements including: “artistic risk, emotional intensity and urgency, reader/viewer participation; [and] an overly literal tone, as if a reporter were viewing a strange culture” (5). when steinberg announces “up front that i will not tell you how the material was gathered” (midlands, 218), this is both to take a big artistic risk, and to engage actively in a dialogue with you, the reader, in something approaching an ‘overly literal tone’. moreover, ‘i’ and ‘you’ are not stable within any of the texts i have chosen, so while the marketing of a work as ‘nonfiction’ sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of i=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. all three writers are addressed as ‘you’ at various different stages by both fictional characters (like professor kondlo) and ‘real’ people like magadien: “i am telling you. i need to be magadien wentzel to live a proper life” (the number, 31) or creina alcock: “the only thing you can do is love” (heart, 409), which is to collapse both writer and reader into the second person. as phillip lopate notes, “the solution to entrapment in the narcissistic hothouse of self is not to relinquish autobiographical writing, but to expand the self by bringing one’s curiosity to interface with more and more history and the present world” (to show and tell, 2013: 10-11). broadly speaking, autobiography has to do with narratives concerned primarily with the self, told by the self; whereas nonfiction – in my terms – has to do with narratives primarily about a wider, shared ‘reality’ told by a self as an act of collaboration with that ‘reality’ and the people, objects, and practices of which it is constituted. steinberg’s work is, again, exemplary in terms of the kinds of collaboration it allows for – not only between writer, characters (who are also interpreters, translators and contributors) and readers – but also between the persona ‘jonny steinberg’ and various well-known south african intellectuals and institutions, from ivan vladislavić to the centre for the study of violence and reconciliation, who funded his research for the number (2004: ix). in a very ‘real’ and open way, steinberg designs textual spaces which de-sign him back, so that it is not only about reading sincerely, but creating works (as both writers and readers) in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside in order to express ‘something more than truthfulness’, something with the same ineffable structure of attridge’s ‘singularity’. anne-marie willis concept of “ontological designing” acknowledges that, while we design our spaces (and here she means literally any self-consciously designed space, be it structural, material, textual or otherwise), “in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed” (“ontological designing”, 2006: 80). therefore, the fact that malan, krog, and steinberg all worked as reporters plays an integral role in the nature and quality of each of their texts. rian malan, descended from the first dutch settlers themselves, worked for a time on “the crime beat” (heart, 35), which obliterated his “certainties” (330) and drove him into exile rather than carry arms for the apartheid government. his fractured experience resulted in an ironic book written and published in english by vintage, “which tells us of the defeat of its authors illusions, his ideals, his sense of courage, his ability to comprehend his fellow south africans as they danced their death dances” (salman rushdie, introductory note). antjie krog, also afrikaans, worked as a reporter at the truth and reconciliation commission, leading to the skin-scorching country of my skull, which she actually wrote in afrikaans first, although published it in english for reasons i will deal with later. jonny steinberg, all of whose books are written and published in english, also worked as a reporter and columnist (some of which is collected into notes from a fractured country (2007)) for a number of publications. just like malan before him, he often ventures into some of the most dangerous and dilapidated parts of the country. rather than irony though, the way he collaborates with both characters and ‘real’ people – who are often impossible to distinguish on account of him being open about the fact that he regularly changes names to protect or respect people – means that uncertainty and a certain kind of fracturing becomes a structural feature of his work. writing in afrikaans and publishing in english, or inserting passages which assess the role of the writing ‘i’, or passages in which writer and reader are collapsed in the second-person address of a character, suggests that the works i have chosen have primarily to do with different kinds of fracture and breaks with representation to get at an ultimately performative array of “turth or trth” (country, 54). this ‘truth’, which krog shows she cannot even type, is unique to each individual, time and experience (apartheid, trc, postapartheid) and yet also shared in some fundamental, “folded”, and common experience of what mark sanders calls “human-being” (complicities, 2002: 89). however, unlike hard news reports, south african nonfiction seems exemplary in that it is not ‘desperate’ for what shields calls “authenticity” (reality, 5). as antjie krog writes: > if you believe your own lie – because as narrators we all give ourselves permission to believe our own versions – how can it be said that you are being misleading? to what extent can you bring yourself not to know what you know? eventually it is not the lie that matters, but the mechanism in yourself that allows you to accept distortions. (country, 133) the use of shifting pronouns is clear here: the second-person address implicates the reader, then the parentheses works to include that reader in a wider circle of narrators, all of whom lie and mislead and accept that their ‘truths’ will always be in some way distorted. nonfiction, in krog’s view, is doomed always to manipulate its ‘trth’ and so is concerned not with authenticity, but with sincerity; with the ability to believe your own lies and thereby perform the ‘truth’ – both while writing, as well as while interpreting/reading/translating that ‘truth’. lionel trilling defined sincerity as “a congruence of avowal and actual feeling” (sincerity and authenticity, 2), going on to point out that it has been “a salient, perhaps a definitive, characteristic of western culture for some four hundred years”(6). most importantly, sincerity retains a notion of the “performative, [of its] theatrical origins” (9). david shields argues that, inundated by such performances, modern readers have become more skeptical than ever “of the desperation of the modernist embrace of art as the only solution, and hyperaware of all artifices of genre and form, [yet] we nevertheless seek new means of creating the real” (24). in order to ‘create the real’ in a believable fashion, adam kelly argues that we need to do away with “the ideal of authenticity, which conceives truth to the self as an end”, and return to trilling’s (and shakespeare’s) formulation of sincerity as an ideal involving “truth to the self [… only] as a means of ensuring truth to the other” (“sincerity”, 132). he goes on: > sincerity places emphasis on intersubjective truth and communication with others, and [with] what trilling calls the ‘public end in view’, authenticity conceives truth as something inward, personal, and hidden, the goal primarily of self-expression rather than other-directed communication. (132) in other words, the kinds of ‘truth’ sincere nonfiction can express are primarily dialogic and affective. essentially, kelly is suggesting that we do not need new means of creating the real, merely old ones that have been reinterpreted within a world inundated by other-directed communication. the question becomes one of creating the ‘real’ in believable ways, which is something malan, krog, and steinberg achieve via different techniques, though i will argue that the collaborative and anticipatory frames within which steinberg conducts his research and writing are exemplary of a new kind of “ontological designing” (anne-marie willis, 2006) beginning to take form in the apparent formlessness of shields’ “antigenre” (reality, 4). --- put differently, sincere writing which anticipates its own ability to manipulate, or marketing that discusses its own narcissism, or ‘reality’ that shows up its own artifice, are all made meaningful only via a collaborative, dialogic, and informative performance of the ‘truth’ they are advertised to represent. antjie krog insists that she writes “fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction” (“i, me, me, mine!”, 2005: 106) which is to make a distinction that, as kelly notes of advertising in general, “highlights the complexity and impurity of all discourse,” that can “only be responded to by acknowledging one’s own implication in [derrida’s] ‘general system of writing’” (“sincerity”, 139). in that the logic of anticipation – or the self-conscious manipulation between person and persona – relies on a response to the other before they have even reacted, performing sincerely and believably requires an assertion of responsibility for one’s audience(s). however, just as “true sincerity, if there ever is such a thing, must take place in the aporia between the conditional and the unconditional” (140), true responsibility – as mark sanders notes – would only be possible before a “more or less transcendental figure of alterity” (complicities, 2002: 98), which is none other than the aporia of death: “sizwe looked into jake’s dying face and saw himself. for a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved” (three letter plague, 30). negotiating the inability to be responsible before anything but death, which is the only thing that ‘truly’ dissolves boundaries like the one between sizwe and jake (or sizwe and steinberg), requires asserting complicity in sanders’ framework: a certain kind of “foldedness in human-being” (98). human-being, the category from which simon mpungose is excluded in my traitor’s heart (212), does not refer only to the human beings we interact with daily, but the “total existential situation of being human in the world” (complicities, 89); of responding in a singular and idiosyncratic way to the shared experience of ‘reality’. importantly though, human-being is not a transcendental point from which to judge truth from ideology; it is rather a “self-conscious placing of the self” (91) within a wider space of reciprocal, translating/translated address. fact and fiction may be impossible to separate in work like malan’s, krog’s, and steinberg’s, but if we lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion for a moment and interpret and translate their words and works sincerely, new possibilities are created for the expression of the ‘the truly valuable in human life’, thereby turning narratives primarily about the self (autobiography) into wider narratives about a more generally applicable and historically recognisable ‘truth’ (nonfiction). rian malan and linguistic address > “we tell stories not to die of life” (country of my skull, 72) my traitor’s heart begins with a direct plea from the “burned out and starving” writer to the “visionary reader” (13). however, malan often steps away from his narrative and ‘listens’ to the testimonies and narratives of people like simon mpungose (181-205) and creina alcock (342-425), becoming the you that they address (409). adam kelly argues that any decision regarding the writer’s intention within an anticipatory framework can “only be made by a particular kind of listener” (“sincerity”, 141) and i think that malan’s use of multiple narrative voices is intended to force both himself and the reader to listen closely to what is being said and who is saying it. by the end of the narrative, the writer admits that “i’m so deeply enmeshed in half-truths and fictionalizations of myself that i will never escape until i simply tell the truth. this was not the book i was contracted to write” (410). fact and fiction are presented as essentially continuous here, and the possibility of ‘simply telling the truth’ after four hundred and ten pages seems as likely to happen as the expression of true sincerity or responsibility. the wobbly manipulation of person and persona, of the i-who-writes and the i-who-was-contracted-to-write, can be read either as a kind of egoism and self-aggrandisement, or (if such egoism is read as already-anticipated) as a sincere plea to have the reader believe that his desire to ‘simply tell the truth’ is the real truth – not facts, not fiction, but the desire to speak your ‘truth’ and be heard. in other words, the believable performance of the ‘truth’ requires both readers and writers to lay aside the hermeneutics of suspicion and find a way back to ‘the truly valuable in human life’, together. emile benveniste explains that “i use i only when i am speaking to someone who will be a you in my address. it is this condition of dialogue that is constitutive of person, for it implies that reciprocally i becomes you in the address of the one who in turn designates himself as i” (problems in general linguistics, 1971: 224-5). again, the marketing of a work as ‘nonfiction’ sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of i=writer and you=reader, though the shifting nature of the pronouns within the actual text complicates greatly each telling. i and you shift, as benveniste later says, between “a set of empty signs […] which are filled as the speaker adopts them” (286): >‘[…] i have noticed there is no fairness on this earth. so, i must die, so that what i dreamed in 1972 be fulfilled. > ‘that is all i wish to say’ > ah, simon, simon, in spite of all i know about you, your words still break my heart. simon was a killer, and yet, as a friend of mine pointed out, his story seemed to unfold like the story of a saint, deeply disturbing in its biblical parallels […] > i heard no hatred or despair in his last words, just clarity, which he seemed to be offering as a man offers a gift – a gift of understanding, i thought, and a warning […] > as it turned out, i presumed a great deal. (heart, 204-5) here, the i starts off as simon, as he was heard speaking in court, then it shifts to the writer, who addresses simon directly (in the present tense), and then the i shifts again to a more personal meditation (presumably malan’s own, in the past tense). simon is presented in this passage as both a psychopathic killer and a saint, sent to save his people with a hammer and a dream. neither interpretation is quite right, but nor is either one entirely wrong. both are unsettled by the shifts in person and tense. simon’s story, which takes up a large part of the total narrative, begins with near fairy-tale like narration: “now comes another tale of ordinary life and extraordinary death in my country. take my hand, and let’s fly like gods to where it happened” (181) and he is introduced first through the eyes of debbie good, one of his victims. the i-who-writes ventriloquises her experience of waking up with simon in her room, using second person narration to chilling effect: > you never know when, but you know it’s coming. and then one night you go to bed around ten. you hear the old red setter barking outside […] all you remember is the split second of terror when you wake up […] drenched in blood […] you’re trying to phone the doctor but you can’t remember how to dial. (186) carrol clarkson discusses how you, as addressee of a literary work, gains another dimension when a persona within the world of the novel is addressed as ‘you’: > the use of persona address has the unnerving effect of placing the reader simultaneously in the grammatical position of the second and third persons, at once present and absent with respect to a double-directedness and mutually exclusive trajectory of address. (coetzee’s countervoices, 2009: 61) reader and writer slip between the shifting pronouns, but this is exactly what malan intends, for to have a fixed concept of the reader is, as clarkson argues, “to ignore the capacity for the invention and freedom of the artwork’s transcendence in the pure potentiality of ‘you’” (61). the ‘pure potentiality of you’ is what makes sincerity a two-way phenomenon – each reader or listener is forced into making a singular and idiosyncratic decision about the intention of dialogic and/or affective modes of address given that the book is advertised as the ‘truth’. in the context of such ‘truth’, what is particularly interesting in my traitor’s heart is that it is not just debbie good’s eyes, but her race, which is ventriloquised: “to understand such things, you must see them in the context of the state of elemental guilt and fear in which white south africans live” (189). you, the reader of an english book, published internationally – but written by an afrikaner with “a sickness of the soul” (412) – can only understand such things if you attempt to see from the perspective of debbie good (all the while noting how this perspective alters and manipulates simon’s story). when reader, writer and characters start to slip between these shifting you’s, she’s, and i’s in nonfiction specifically, then it is perhaps not quite ‘pure potentiality’ we should speak of, but a limited potential to experience the ‘truth’ as it applies to more than just one’s self: though malan’s work is “full of bitterness, cynicism, anger and storms, [it is also] a triumphant instance of […] defeated love” (salman rushdie, introductory note). simon’s courtroom testimony, which appears in quotation marks (181-205) is occasionally interrupted by the i-who-writes to provide more information about the people in the gallery, or the finer points of zulu metaphor. this may seem problematic – what gives malan the right to interpret when the court obviously could not? – but the writer is also quick to note the fact that “the prisoner’s words defeated the interpreter” (202). once again, we are given the opportunity to read the interpretations as manipulative or as springing from the writer’s self-aware sense of defeated love. simon’s smile vanishes, he sobs, “and then he was suddenly bellowing and howling, like a man in unendurable pain. it was a harrowing sound, the sound of a bull with a sword in its heart” (202). mark sanders makes the point that > standing in for the other is both a basic expression of human foldedness, and, as it always is, a taking of the place of the other by a particular other, which is what necessitates the constant negotiation of who speaks for whom […] folded into any act of representation or advocacy is an other-intendedness that makes it possible at once to portray and betray. (complicities, 207) malan’s interruptions and interpretations, sincerely read, are both a basic expression of a kind of foldedness with simon made profound only because it is advertised as the ‘truth’ and, inevitably, a betrayal in the sense that simon is, once more, reduced to a largely english, largely white audience. attempting to negotiate portrayal and betrayal, as well as the pitfalls of interpretation and (translated, legal) representation, malan travels to empangeni – where simon was born – to try and understand more of the ‘truth’ about the hammerman. he discovers the story of a boy cast out from society on account of the incest committed by his grandparents, spoken of as if he were the “living dead, as one who “never became human” (heart, 207). sanders argues that “one’s human-being depends on a relation to an other and thus involves an affectual and ethical dimension, which, as fanon notes, can be actualized or destroyed in the structure of linguistic address” (complicities, 183). to understand why one might be excluded from such human-being for the sins of one’s forebears, malan starts simon’s story over again, “from the very beginning, as all stories must be told” (heart, 209), requiring that “we talk of the ancestors” (212). they “are that close, that omnipresent” (212). in simon’s culture, the ancestors are quite literal, experienced, and immanent embodiments of sanders’ “more or less transcendental figure[s] of alterity” (complicities, 98) required to negotiate the aporia inherent in the structure of true responsibility. in this sense, they (also quite literally) regulate entry into the category ‘human-being’, preventing people like simon – who is an “abomination” (211) due to his incestuous grandparents – from attaining full personhood. after meeting various members of simon’s family, malan asks: “so what was the truth of simon?” (222), eventually conceding that > these were facts, not myths, although what freight they carried i could not say. i was deaf in simon’s language, and blind in his culture. > in the end, all i really understood of simon was that terrible scream […] i understood it because it was couched in the universal language of human pain. (224) though he cannot understand what is at stake in such facts, the ‘universal language of pain’ malan identifies is also alluded to by antjie krog, who would make nomonde calata’s tears into the “signature cry” (country, 43) of the truth and reconciliation commission in 1998. carli coetzee, amongst many others, has noted the problems inherent in such universalising claims, arguing (quite validly) that they turn the body, specifically bodies like those of nomonde calata, into “a cathartic symbol of a supposedly national myth”, which constitutes more of a betrayal than a portrayal (“they never wept”, 2000: 5). in the same way, using a real person like simon mpungose’s story as a means to anything, no matter how valuable it may seem, will always imply a strong element of betrayal. there is, in a sense, no answer to this conundrum other than to point out, again, that it is the possibility of manipulation or betrayal which makes concepts like sincerity meaningful, responsible and response-able. as adam kelly explains, “the two poles become interminably entangled in any action, and we can never know for certain […] if any single event of giving or receiving is the genuine article or not” (“sincerity”, 139). even if malan and his readers are deaf in simon’s language and cannot tell apart the poles of betrayal and portrayal, or truth and its performance; there is still a lesson to be learnt, a lesson that can be learnt: “in [south africa], white men assumed that they were the centre of the black universe – that they had subjugated the dreams and psyches of africans, along with their bodies. it simply wasn’t true. that is what simon taught me” (heart, 235). it is a deeply profound lesson to learn, especially in the late 1980’s, when south africa was at its most violent and murderous. moreover, the end of malan’s book in fact overturns exactly the white man’s assumption, as neil alcock ascends (via a spirit stick) into the realm of death – and the immanent ancestors – hopefully to guide his people back home to a place where they can assert responsibility and foldedness in human-being: > ‘neil, he was same like a black man. the skin was white, but the heart it was same like a black’ […] they stood over the spot where their white brother was slain, and invited his spirit to enter their sacred stick. ‘numzaan,’ they said, ‘we have come to fetch you. come, let us go home’ […] the horns were a reminder of the ceremony performed that day, a sign that the household within had honoured its shades […] aeons after our ancestors walked away, the first white man had come home to stay. (424-5) these final words carry a strong sense of the performative, mimicking the ceremony that has been carried out to cleanse and honour neil’s house – a symbol of how he and creina are “the only white people who lived beyond all suspicion of complicity” (342) – and yet they return neil (via a textual staging) to his place amongst the immanent ancestors who are honoured on a day-to-day basis in acts intended to advance the truly valuable in human life, like love, trust, faith, and responsibility. to me, that is enough to risk betrayal and encourage sincere writing, reading, and listening once more. country of my skull, translation and singularity > “it is language that shoots up like fire – wrought from a vision of where we must go and from a grip on where we are now” (country of my skull, 230-1) of all three writers i have chosen, kelly’s ‘logic of anticipation’ applies most directly to antjie krog and, more specifically, to her language(s) in that her work is premised on different kinds of translations: between languages, between races, and between generations. she confirmed, via email, that country of my skull (1998) > […] was first written in afrikaans and then translated by my son. i gave the first chapter to somebody with mothertongue english but found the text then too english to enter or change or own. it felt foreign. my son’s text kept its afrikaans underground and could be worked on. > my engels was te swak om country te vertaal daardie tyd, so ook change of tongue. begging is ook in afrikaans geskryf maar my engels is nou goed genoeg om nie-fiksie te vertaal. (ek dink). > “my english was too weak to translate country at the time [1997-8], as was the case with change of tongue [2003]. begging [to be black (2009)] was also written in afrikaans, but my english is now good enough to translate nonfiction. (i think)”. (translation my own. 6 may 2015) even casual communication is (at least) bilingual for krog, though her admission that her english is weak is interesting given that derek attridge notes how “most afrikaans writers have an excellent grasp of [english]” (“singularity”, 15). krog’s active (mis)use of languages, combined with her insistence that she “writes fiction bordering on fact while marketing it as nonfiction” (“i, me, me, mine!”, 2006: 106) results only in more questions. why is nonfiction (especially work like hers, which uses poetry and ‘fictional elements’) easier to translate than fiction or poetry; does ‘english that keeps its afrikaans underground’ suppress the original language or use it as a foundation; and how are we to understand any of her claims in the light of kate highman’s revelations about the extent of “plagiarism” and “ventriloquism” in country (“forging”, 2015: 188)? and, if reading sincerely is a case of eliding the distinction between ‘truth’ and its performance, does ‘plagiarism’ really amount to misuse? starting with the second question, the word for ‘keep to’ in afrikaans (in the sense of biblical commandments) is ‘onderhoud’ – which sounds very similar to ‘underground’ and is what i think krog means in her email: her son’s translation kept its afrikaans grounding, hence she could work it over herself before publishing in english. in other words, the feeling of an other language (afrikaans) at work beneath country at once grounds the text and undermines it in the sense that something is always, as attridge says, “lost in translation” (“singularity”, 17). moreover, when switching between languages or highlighting (for instance) that she can only ever write the “trth or turth” (country, 54) krog seems – if anything – actively to encourage singular readings which are as sincere, anticipatory and performative as the claim that the writer cannot actually write ‘truth’ in a nonfiction text. “singularity is not universal or transcendent,” derek attridge explains, but it is what “the artist, often without being fully aware of how it is happening, is able to apprehend and articulate by reforming and revising the forces that are excluding it” (“singularity”, 10). unfortunately, some of krog’s revisions seem to take on their own exclusionary nature (see the adapted testimony of johannes lekotse and highman’s analysis of it (“forging”, 198)), but she is able to apprehend and articulate various kinds of ‘trth’ and ‘turth’ without ever actually claiming that what she writes is entirely authentic. putting aside the question of authenticity in nonfiction appears to allow for what attridge calls singularities “that can be encountered rather than [those] which [are] completely inaccessible to thought or feeling” (2). such encounters range from the second-person, chilling narration of moments like the one involving debbie good (heart, 182), or the fragrant anthem krog hears between the suffering at the trc (country, 328), or the collaborative, de-signed dialogue of the number and three letter plague to come. attridge argues that singularity shares, in particular, a great many features with derrida’s concept of iterability: a ‘literary’ work – or a signature – is “irreducibly singular […] yet its singularity only has purchase outside itself, and is only intelligible, because it is repeatable” (3). just as the experience of this life is simultaneously uniquely yours and common to every being, singularities are unique moments of sincere personal response to a text that nevertheless contain some ineffable, universal thing. for instance, i think it not utterly preposterous to claim that nearly one’s entire critical appreciation of krog’s text comes down to the singular decision of you the reader to entertain seriously her (deeply problematic) claim that she can write a narrative “for every black victim with an afrikaner surname on their lips” (country, dedication). kate highman rejects this claim, and with good reason. she argues that there is a tension in krog’s writing – and thought – between “specific black voices” and “the generic black voice,” noting that “authorship in country is highly unstable – words are repeatedly re-ascribed away from their contexts and re-assigned” (“forging”, 188). through a careful and detailed analysis of krog’s sources (acknowledged and unacknowledged), highman argues that there are too many notable elisions between ‘my real’ and ‘the real’ in country, which means that krog’s “ultimate accountability is to her own authorial self […] rather than to a reader or unspecified addressee or other” (203). certainly, there are extremely worrying contradictions in both krog’s writing and thought. though she argues, in response to her critics, that the “imagination is active in the narrative discourse, not in inventing reality” (“i, me, me mine!”, 106), she invents (predominantly black) figures like professor kondlo and conversations with people, like the journalist after winnie madikizela-mandela’s hearing at the trc (“forging”, 195-9). she adds to, edits and otherwise changes four essential pieces of testimony used to frame her whole narrative in ways which she actively seeks to hide by placing the fragments in quotation marks (189-95). she plagiarises intellectuals like elaine scarry, ariel dorfman, pierre bourdieu, and julian pitt-rivers without acknowledging them, and often elides or over-simplifies key distinctions in their thought, ostensibly in pursuit of the kind of language which shoots up like fire, with both a vision of where ‘we’ could get to and a firm grip on where ‘we’ are now (country, 230-1). admittedly, krog lifts large passages without acknowledgement, and adapts them in ways which are not true to their original context (“forging”, 196-8). however, the elision she makes (for instance) between honour=virtue and honour=precedent, which is so important to pitt-rivers’ argument (198), does not necessarily amount to misuse precisely because authorship is so unstable in the text. it is not at all clear whose ‘honour’ is at stake, so whether that honour is properly represented is less important than the way it is intended to be read in the context of performing the ‘truth’ and anticipating suspicious readings even as detailed and nuanced as highman’s. for instance, when krog publishes some of her mother’s essays as part of country, which read: “i prayed that my hand should fall off if i ever write something for my personal honour at the cost of my people” (country, 98) it becomes impossible to tell quite whose honour the text is referring to; krog’s, her mother’s, her family’s, her tribe’s, her race’s, etc. this is complicated further by the fact that the original text was translated from afrikaans by her son, so might not his ‘honour’ also be brought into question? whatever the reader’s decision, it is clear that krog’s “ultimate accountability” cannot only be to her “authorial self” (“forging”, 203), when that self is so utterly impossible to untangle from the various generations and translations responsible for the text of country of my skull in its totality. furthermore, it is not at all clear whether publishing an originally afrikaans essay in english constitutes an actual (rather than a merely linguistic) betrayal of her mother’s intention and language or not. there is certainly more than enough evidence to suggest that krog’s decision to publish in english constitutes a self-conscious betrayal of the blood-lined identity of her family’s language: > how do i live with the fact that all the words used to humiliate, all the orders given to kill, belonged to language of my heart? at the hearings, many of the victims faithfully reproduced these parts of their stories in afrikaans as proof of the bloody fingerprints on them. (238) however, it is possible – via krog’s unique and idiosyncratic mechanisms of distortion – that, in translating her mother’s essay (along with the whole text), she might be betraying her inherited linguistic structures while staying true to the meaning of the words; for is the project of country not precisely to write something for (all) her people, whom she so desperately wants to believe are both black and white, paying (instead of betraying) with her health, her relationships, and her sense of anything like a stable authorial self, which is to say, with her ‘sanity’? rather than merely criticising krog for betraying body’s like nomonde calata’s, modern readers, ‘in love with artifice’ and seeking ‘new ways to create the real’, might also be attracted to the “little red light” on the trc microphones, “the ultimate symbol of the whole process: here the marginalised voice speaks to the public ear, the unspeakable is spoken – and translated – the personal story brought from the innermost depths of the individual binds us anew to the collective” (359). krog is actively employing a frame of paradox here – the unspeakable must always remain unspoken if it is to be ‘truly’ unspeakable, ‘ultimate symbols’ of a process as complex and multi-faceted as the trc are extremely suspicious (even if sincere), and the marginalised voice cannot ever speak to the public ear without distortions which try to map or transform our individual experiences into collective truths. krog is well aware of the contradictions though, as her essay-response to critics cited above suggests, so the big question really is: why still write in this manner? perhaps it is because she actively seeks to implicate herself and stage her own complicity, so that her apology can become ‘truly’ meaningful in the mind of the reader. in order to do so, much like malan, she adopts a number of different voices: > dare i sit in this grape dark > during this return journey where my body is overcome > by grief my heart coagulate resigned > > write i – a blue slit against this all. . . (53) later, another writing persona – this time a psychologist – explains that: “in my job there are, in a sense, no lies – all of it ties in, reacts to, plays upon the truth” (117). these two passages seem to anticipate most of highman’s objections, for every lie ‘plays upon’ the truth, while the poet sits contemplating darkness and grief, only to write i, which is no more than a shifting blue slit, simultaneously against – and constitutive – of ‘this all’. country of my skull ends with another poem: > […] > i was scorched > a new skin > i am changed forever. i want to say: > > forgive me > forgive me > forgive me > > you whom i have wronged, please > take me > > with you (423) the last three, fractured lines – in particular – represent a desire to apologise ‘truly’ that is primarily dialogic and affective. the ‘i’ will always betray the ‘you’ in any attempt to portray that you, yet the two remain fundamentally constitutive of each other. translated apology, which changes the ‘i’ forever, becomes krog’s way of signing in her own tune, of writing “something which responds or corresponds in an equally singular, which is to say irreducible, irreplaceable, ‘new’ way” (“singularity”, 5). attridge explains that singularity, in the ‘literary’ sense, is “a constellation made possible for both creator and reader by habits of interpreting, thinking, and feeling, inculcated in the course of an existence within a culture or cultures” (7). within this constellation, different versions of the ‘trth or turth’ can exist without necessarily contradicting one another, instead bringing readers to a point where the distinction between ‘truth’ and its performance is less important than deciding which ‘truth’ seems most applicable and what this might suggest about the reader’s relationship to ‘truth’ and ‘reality’ in general. krog, in particular, seems fine with literally inventing some characters and, though the fact that they are black is particularly forced and problematic, mark sanders makes the point that > it is precisely this element of invention that, along with its active acknowledgement, has the potential to bring a dimension of responsibility to the management of transition. […] when that past is understood as invented, it can yield a structure of ongoing responsibility rather than a remedy meant to work once and for all. (complicities, 127) country of my skull, regrettably, lacks a large part of the sort of ‘active acknowledgement’ that sanders refers to, which means that highman’s argument remains valid. however, there are certain moments that she misses on account of the hermeneutics of suspicion she employs, moments in which krog’s signature tune strikes too deep a chord to be dismissed as mere plagiarism. attridge argues that singularity “must partake of generality or universality: the signature must use the inscription codes of a particular language” (“singularity”, 4). quoting an interview of his with derrida, he explains that “to become readable, [signatures of ‘literary’ works] have to be divided, to participate and belong. then it […] takes its part in the genre, the type, the context, the meaning […] it loses itself to offer itself (4). in that country was written in afrikaans, but published in english first, it is, by its very nature, already-divided between languages. being already-divided means that the text can participate in (at least) two cultural contexts (afrikaans and south african english), and at least three genres: ‘fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction’ in the attempt to make “these narratives alone enough to justify the existence of the truth commission. because […] people can no longer indulge in their separate dynasties of denial” (country, 134). the ultimate success, such as it may be, of krog’s work lies in the passages that are not written as a white, or a black (or ‘the black’), or a poet, or a psychologist, or a man, or a woman, but by a human-being who was “made to write this story” (54), another performance to be believed, or not; > and i wonder: god. does he hear us? does he know what our hearts are yearning for? that we all just want to be human – some with more colour, some with less, but all with air and sun. and i wade into song – in a language that is not mine, in a tongue i do not know. it is fragrant inside the song, and among the keynotes of sorrow and suffering there are soft silences where we who belong to this landscape, all of us, can come to rest. > sometimes the times we live in overflow with light. (328) as with simon’s bellow, you can almost hear the fragrant and idiosyncratic tune, even if it is inevitably distorted by krog’s contradictions and downright dishonesties. it is in a strange language, and it is full of suffering and sorrow, but there is a sense of belonging in it, of the kind of peace attained by neil alcock. from between the endless lines of sorrow and death and all ‘the ways in which we killed one another’, floats the suggestion of a fragrant time overflowing with light, premised on the keynote of human-being, ‘universal’ suffering, and foldedness this entails. the possibility that the expression of such foldedness might be true, again, seems worth the risk of betraying the human beings and their stories which the sincere author seeks to portray. jonny steinberg and ontological designing > “to assimilate truth piece by piece” (country of my skull, 193) steinberg, malan, and krog have all appeared on panel discussions together, the most recent entitled “in a place where you couldn’t make this shit up”, at the 2010 cape town book fair. while each wrote/writes at a unique and specific time, their work shares many similarities, chief among them the fact that, though the marketing of a work as ‘nonfiction’ sets up a supposedly simple textual relationship of i=writer and you=reader, the shifting nature of the pronouns within their texts complicates each telling. malan pleaded with ‘visionary readers’ in the late 1980’s to see the ways in which south africans were killing each other and to seek, instead, a different kind of love: > ‘you said one could be deformed by this country, and yet it seems to me one can only be deformed by the things one does to oneself […] the only thing you can do is love, because it’s the only thing which leaves light inside you, instead of total, obliterating darkness.’ (heart, 409) the ‘you’ here actually refers to malan, who is listening to creina alcock speak. the shifting pronouns allow “the truly valuable in human life” (“sincerity”, 135) to exist for a moment without irony, rendered sincerely through the voice of an other, an i-who-is-not-the-writer, while the writer and the reader become essentially indistinguishable as the you who is addressed. krog (and her son) translate her own and other’s work (as well as, problematically, adapting testimony to suit her own ends) which is to say she stages her own complicity in acts of plagiarism and (mis)appropriation, but insists on being read in a bilingual, impure, performative context of “fact bordering on fiction but marketing it as nonfiction” (“i, me, me, mine!”, 106). in addition to the psychologist, or the apologetic poet, krog also inserts the voices of others into the narrative, from her mother’s essays to the student from ladybrand, whose poem krog leaves in afrikaans, and then translates into english on the opposite page (country, 316-7). the final, circular couplet sums up how i read the intention of krog’s multilingual, multigenerational text, in that it captures the attempt to hear the various voices at work in the text, to see the value in the mere fact that the narrative even exists: “as jy gesien het/ het jy vir altyd gesien” (316). as already noted, steinberg acknowledges in his first book that “i am forced by the colour of my skin to employ others as my eyes and ears, and i am therefore prone to all the failures of my predecessors. i announce up front that i will not tell you how the material was gathered” (midlands, 218). he self-consciously places his authorial self by virtue of his skin colour and the line of (white) writers of which he is a part, while simultaneously setting his (ethnographic) methodology apart from those who have come before him. it is important that one of the defining characteristics he identifies in his predecessors is ‘failure’. in a sense, white south african writing can only be dialogic and affective, it can only anticipate an other’s response, precisely by failing; by performing believably the human failure of its own ‘traitorous heart’. if it does so, such nonfiction might have the potential, like nothing as experienced a reader and writer as salman rushdie has “read before”, to express “the demotic voice of black and afrikaner south africa” (heart, introductory note, emphasis added). steinberg seems to feel, from his first book, that he owes “something more than truthfulness” (xi) to his subjects. however, instead of irony, translation, and (mis)appropriation, he attempts to create a more open and honest sense of collaboration aimed at collapsing the distinction between ‘truth’ and its performance entirely. as twidle notes of his “flat […] character-driven prose” (“in a place”, 10), steinberg quite literally collaborates with people like magadien wentzel or sizwe magadla to produce works like the number (2004) and three letter plague (2009), but i think the way he designs his research and the resultant texts goes far deeper than these collaborations. in all his work, steinberg actively acknowledges both the readers, critics, and intellectuals who helped him, from mark gevisser and anthony altbeker, to ivan vladislavič – “from whose experience and perspicacity [steinberg] benefited three times in a row” (three letter plague, 390) – as well as the institutions which funded and supported his research. from the centre for the study of violence and reconciliation, to the development corporation ireland (the number, vii), all are faithfully and openly acknowledged as having played a role in the overall design of each work. these acknowledgements may seem like staples of a certain kind of ethnographic, academic research and texts. however, anne-marie willis explains that ‘ontological designing’ – i.e. self-consciously creating different ‘ways of knowing’ – is “a theory: > that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; > that designing is fundamental to being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e.,through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); > that this adds up to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts back […] and designs us.” (80) acknowledging one’s sources is certainly not unique to steinberg, but the point here is that openly designing and honestly discussing the ways in which one comes to ‘know’ something adds a further element of responsibility to nonfiction texts by showing them to be divided (between different character’s interpretations, different reader’s opinions, and different institution’s requirements) and therefore allowing them to ‘participate in and belong to’ various different contexts and ‘realities’ (“singularity”, 4). ontological designing is also an extension of kelly’s logic: we anticipate other’s reactions in such a way that “inner states lose their originating causal status and instead become effects of that anticipatory logic” (“sincerity”, 136) and, in the same way (although applied not just to others, but practices and objects as well) “we design our world, while our world acts back […] and designs us” (“designing”, 80). steinberg’s carefully researched, ethnographic, character-driven prose shows how anticipatory logic can be used not only to negotiate irony (like malan) or complicity (like krog), but actively to design textual spaces in which the hermeneutics of suspicion ought to be laid aside momentarily so as to consider the possibilities believing any given performance might allow. “it occurred to me that of all the motives that propelled magadien to cooperate so enthusiastically with the writing of this book, this was the most important: he wanted to rescue his history from the tongues of others” (the number, 371). here is another example of a frame of paradox: the implication that magadien might be able to rescue his history from the tongues of others is only accessible through, or legible because of, the pen of exactly such a white, english-speaking, upper-middle-class other. but this is also exactly the point; steinberg’s is just a pen, the number just a book, which is to say that it is concerned with “artifice […] and new means of creating the ‘real’” (reality, 4). in understanding the ‘real’ – in this case, a space where magadien has rescued his story from the tongues of others – as fundamentally created, readers can self-consciously choose whether to believe the persona ‘jonny steinberg’ and his collaborators (sizwe and magadien at the level of characters, vladislavić and altbeker at the level of readers, the csvr etc. at the level of institutions), or not. i suggest that jonny steinberg’s work takes the logic of anticipation and applies it with a “radically different understanding of how modern subjects are and come to be who/what we are in the modern world” (“ontological designing, 2006: 80). we can re-read an earlier quotation, sentence for sentence, in the context of ontological designing: > i shut up. the subject had dusted off his most eloquent words and shut the ‘i’ up. but he had, of course, told the ‘i’ precisely what every ‘i’ wants to hear. he had assuaged my bad conscience, had given me licence to scorch his heart and open his soul. the victory was mine, not his, and it left me feeling no less anxious than before. (the number, 242) the first sentence represents an assertion of unbridled agency on the writing persona’s part – he actively shuts up and creates a silent world. however, this is complicated by the next two sentences, written from a perspective outside the i-who-writes, which suggest that it is not the ‘i’ who shut up, but rather the subject the ‘i’ was in dialogue with who shut that ‘i’ up. furthermore, it was, in fact, the subject who anticipated “what every ‘i’ wants to hear”, rather than the other way around. the perspective then shifts back to within the i-who-writes, but no longer does he engage in bald and uncomplicated assertions of agency. rather, he expresses the nuanced sort of acknowledgement which could potentially collapse the distinction between truth and its performance: the ‘victory’ (that is, the licence to portray the ‘heart’ and ‘soul’ of an other) remains, inevitably, the (believably) anxious writing persona’s. to reiterate, in the context of textual spaces in which “we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed” (“designing, 80), the logic of anticipation works two ways. though the ‘i’ is unable to transcend the kind of betrayal that representational ‘victory’ always implies, steinberg seems to have created a space where the subject’s words anticipate what he, as the writing persona ‘i’, needs to hear. and it is not just him, but every ‘i’, every writing (and reading) persona within the text. this is achieved both through the way steinberg openly interacts with the characters (who are also real people, although their real names are not given), readers (both ‘the reader’ of his text, and ‘real’ people like gevisser, altbeker etc.) and institutions which make up his textual environment. by showing actively how he has designed this textual environment, steinberg simultaneously reveals how the environment, also, designs his texts. we are no longer speaking only of writing and reading sincerely so as to elide the distinction between truth and its performance, in search of different possibilities for meaning and the expression of the ‘truly valuable in human life’. ontological designing is about creating singular works which actively collapse truth and its performance in order to get at ‘something more than truthfulness’. in the number, this something seems primarily to have to do with how one chooses to name things. “he has always understood the power of this mask […] it is william, but it cannot possibly be william” (299) steinberg explains, showing how the character ‘magadien’, too, shifts between various identities that he self-consciously creates for himself. earlier in the text, steinberg questions magadien about how much really hinges on a name, to which the subject takes offense: “my life goes round in these circles. you ask why a name is so important. i am telling you why. i need to be magadien wentzel to live a proper life’” (31). here, again, we have both writer and reader addressed as ‘you’ in dialogue with a character in the text. the writer’s (and reader’s) question is answered – is anticipated by – magadien, who is always in the process of telling, in the process of revealing aspects of his identity the writing persona cannot, actually, claim full ‘victory’ over. here, the subject speaks as ‘i’ and is, again, able to anticipate the writing persona’s questions, to exercise his own agency in terms of how he is read and understood. ultimately, magadien’s obsession with naming is revealed to stem from his need to have “the truth written on my grave” (92). again then, the reader is confronted by the impossibility of true responsibility before anything but the “more or less transcendental figure of alterity” (complicities, 98) which is embodied by death, or more specifically here, ‘my grave’. the appeal to death as originary of a different kind of responsibility (and collaboration) is a pattern which gets repeated in greater detail in steinberg’s following work, three letter plague, which is, again, radically open about its own “uniquely intimate, uniquely intrusive” structure (2009: 183). although very different from magadien, the persona labeled ‘sizwe’ is also no more than his own, unique “assemblage of paradoxes” (47), acting as an “interpreter-subject” in a text often written using the pronoun “we” (247). sizwe’s becomes a story of identifying with the dying and dead in strange – but often surprisingly innovative and courageous – ways given his context; while he remains living on his own, uniquely flawed, terms. > sizwe looked into jake’s dying face and saw himself. for a moment in that room, the boundaries between the two men dissolved. who lay on the bed and who stood up healthy and strong was merely a question of chance. it was an unusual moment, one that embodied an attitude to aids that sizwe would struggle to re-create in time to come. for it is not an easy thing identifying with the dying and the dead. among our deepest responses to them is an unacknowledged feeling of triumph. (30-1) truthfully, how could the writing persona ever know what sizwe saw when he looked into jake’s dying face, and is it not deeply offensive to assume he could? my proposition is that reading sincerely and actively designing a singular response to (collaborative) performances aimed at ‘dissolving boundaries’ – or writing the truth on ‘my grave’ – does not make universalising or generalising assumptions like the above any less problematic or narcissistic. however, by the end of the passage, through a seemingly heartfelt acknowledgement that it is no easy thing to identify with the dying and dead, the writing persona shifts to the pronoun ‘our’. and so what if this ‘our’ is the fictional result of problematic generalisation? if white south african nonfiction writers insist upon writing ‘fiction bordering on fact but marketing it as nonfiction’, then does it not seem almost noble (and a little tragic), that the pronoun ‘our’ is the element of fiction they would use “to enable our facts to arrive at the truth” ( i’, me, me, mine!”, 101)? the element for which writers are willing to take almost any kind of artistic risk, from adopting and adapting the voices of others, translating their own (and other’s work), plagiarising, misappropriating, shifting between pronouns, dissolving boundaries and designing dialogue which de-signs their own ability to represent their subjects? claiming the ability to anticipate others’ reactions necessarily implies an element of narcissism and egoism, to which all that can be said is that sincerity, too, depends on the possibility of manipulation and – indeed – it is precisely this possibility which renders the idea meaningful at all. attridge’s concept of the ‘singularity’ of literary works has always depended on the reader, or “human translator”, and their singular “decision” which attempts to stay faithful to “the singularizing event” (“singularity”, 17-8). the whole point of advertising work as ‘nonfiction’, or of adopting a logic of anticipation, or of designing ontologies within any given text, is to allow for and encourage the “human translator” to create or de-sign their own response to the singular events surrounding each text. rather than question authenticity, each reader, therefore, ought to ask of each performance which interpretation, which unacceptable decision, seems most ‘true’ to them and what this might imply about their own relationship to ‘reality’ and the ‘truth’, both as an individual and as part of a collective – that is ‘black’ or ‘white’ or ‘south african’. conclusion > “perhaps, in the end, that was hermann’s gift to lusikisiki […] people who had come to see, through the potency of their own deeds, that the horizon of the possible stretched further than they had ever imagined” (three letter plague, 328). this, i would argue, is primarily what steinberg’s ethnographic methodology is aimed at expressing: just how potent anyone’s own deeds can be in terms of creating or designing the ways in which we read and translate (performances of) the ‘truth’, whether it is as writer, reader, ‘real’ person, or character. more generally, though the marketing of nonfiction sets up a superficial relationship of i=writer, and you=reader, the ways pronouns shift within all the supposedly ‘true’ texts i have chosen above is used by all three writers to create dialogic and affective texts in which the distinction between truth and its performance is not as important, perhaps, as deciding – in the way of a singular ‘human translator attempting to stay true to the ‘singularizing event’ – what kinds of meaning are to be found by believing the marketing claims and reading sincerely (which is also to perform in a certain way). the representational ‘victory’, the betrayal, the universalising impulse to describe individual bodies or screams as symbolic of a national narrative of pain and healing all remain the writer’s (and reader’s, who is often collapsed with the writer as ‘you’ in the address of a character). however, by asserting ‘our’ own complicity, or by actively designing and de-signing textual spaces, both writers and readers can negotiate the distinction between truth and its performance and seek, instead, “something more than truthfulness” (midlands, 218). this something, i suggest, has the same indescribable, ineffable structure as attridge’s ‘singularity’, though it can be said to originate not only in death, but also in love: “his love is of course selfish: it is his progeny, and no one else, for whom he wakes up in the mornings. but what fiery and desperate love it is” (three letter plague, 343): the sort of defeated love that could lead a few human-beings back home; the appropriated love of a forged and fragrant song, a selfish love for those yet to come and those already-gone; a crying love, universal at times, but lost when we wake from our dreams and can no longer see “the grand design, such as it is” (heart, 13). --- geometric proof > ‘[…] love is worth nothing until tested by its own defeat […] i realized that love, even if it ends in defeat, gives you a kind of honour; but without love, you have no honour at all. i think that is what i misunderstood all my life. love is to enable you to transcend defeat. > ‘you said one could be deformed by this country, and yet it seems to me one can only be deformed by the things one does to oneself […] the only thing you can do is love, because its the only thing which leaves light inside you, instead of total, obliterating darkness. (traitor’s, 409) what follows below is, while seemingly silly, actually a geometric summation of the thesis above, otherwise entitled ‘an argument for happiness’. the stages on which ‘our’ consciousness now unfolds are definitely more complex. sooner than you think, some humans will be computing with matter itself, while others turn the earth into a radio-telescope to keep up the eternal search for our origins, while for millions more not a single thing will be different. if one were to think of evolution as a series of haphazardly-linked circles, then it sometimes seems as if we fall further and further into complexity. however, one might just as well see it as a rise, a move against entropy. “as a result of a thousand million years of evolution, the universe is becoming conscious of itself, able to understand something of its past history and its possible future” (julian huxley, “transhumanism” in new bottles for new wine (1957): 13) see also alain de botton: “although this house may lack solutions to a great many of its occupants’ ills, its rooms nevertheless give evidence of a happiness to which [design] has made a distinctive contribution” (the architecture of happiness. london: penguin, 2006: 11). works cited attridge, derek. “contemporary afrikaans fiction and english translations: singularity and the question of minor languages”, 2014.

selected pieces from the aphorisms highlighted at the bottom of each page. though nothing has been added, and his words are presented here as he wrote them, i have carefully ordered them to draw out some specific threads which touched my heart. this act of curation takes on many dimensions in the digital world, because our words are - in a sense - only given meaning by that which they leave out, just as music is made meaningful only by the silence which punctuates each note. when you leave out essentially the entire internet, the few pearls you do select take on far more gravity when parsed by an empty mind and a pure heart. please stop here and take a moment to breathe. allow yourself to sink into the silence between each impulse. let your attention return to its seat in your heart. now we can begin. --- we cover our ignorance about our true nature with the roles that we play in life. to recognize a fault in others means that we have that same tendency within us. we have medicalised our health, industrialised our leisure, and commercialised our wellness. the real answer lies in meditative practices. meditation becomes transformative when attention and focus flows into boundless consciousness, without a goal or predetermined direction. with reflection, one realises that inner and outer states are in constant resonance or entanglement. a healthy body, clear mind, and pure heart are our primal duties. the more insight we have, the greater will be our foresight. we carry within us the story of galactic events as well as the subatomic mysteries. spiritual awakening will reveal boundless reality. we ask when, why, and how life began. plausible answers transcend the intellect and causality. they are heart-felt. when normal mental activity and thoughts cease, you are along the path that leads to the origin of creation. to go beyond mind, reason, and habits is the ultimate act of intelligence. the mystery of life is as wide as the universe itself. we are constant migrants, journeying towards origin and the state before creation. our origin and essence is perpetual in its perfect beingness. the end is where the beginning was: ever constant and present. everything is heading towards completion. you are not who you think you are. only when thoughts stop and identity is lost can one be at the door of sacred presence. within the still moment lies a zone of transcendence of mind and time. that is the infinitude of reality. time and space are frames in which identity is given a temporary virtual reality which draws its energy from the one reality. to transcend time you need to follow a trustworthy map and live along a path that unifies shadows and lights. the present moment is the most potent and powerful link to the essence of time. the past is not present. neither is the future. now is present and is the connection with timelessness and all times. it contains all, yet there is no thing in the present. it is in time, yet free of time. once we have tasted timelessness we may come to realize the presence of eternity within our own heart: the perpetual moment. even patience and limitation become sweet: this is when you are accessing timelessness. the dancer unifies with the dance and both vanish into the mystery of the harmony of sound. when the mind is still and the heart is pure, the realisation of what had always been becomes obvious: oneness and no otherness. the purpose of human life is to experience existence through the lens of oneness without denying the temporary experience of pluralities. the primal purpose is to witness the beauty, majesty and perfection of the cosmic spirit: ever-present as the human soul. the ultimate purpose of human life is to experience the infinitude of life itself and dwell therein. when the nature of the soul is realized, then the ideas of freedom or choice disappear and what remains is blissful peace. peace is at the edge of space and time. it is still, stable, and constant. constant victory is a state within higher consciousness where everything is part of oceanic unity and perpetuity. the self yearns to be welcomed and the soul is the most perfect host. the soul is free from the notion of limitation or liberation. the ultimate fitness is to live as a soul. that is perfection. the enlightened being lives on earth as it is part of the hereafter and is constantly revitalised by this magnificent realization. what makes death easy, natural, and acceptable is the personal experience of cosmic consciousness and boundless life. souls unify. minds differ. the illusion of duality is a driving force in life towards unity. the awakened person was a self and now is a soul. perfect destiny. illumination is to experience the stillness and timelessness that underlie all change and transition. by observing otherness and difference with insight and reflection, we may know and experience the essence of sameness and oneness. the sacred language of oneness is the origin of all that we hear and know. it brings about human liberation and sustainable contentment. the human quest is the personal realisation of the origin of life and the one source that permeates and governs all. all life and awareness has emerged from one source which is the only perpetual reality. sameness and otherness overflow from oneness: the incomparable one, unique and all pervasive; the cause of the universe. the realisation that there is only oneness and no otherness is awakening. the treasure of the soul is found when all else is lost. the soul is supreme. the one is true. thank the one source of all."

    "content": "bursts what was said on beams applies equally here. please stop for a moment and focus on your breath. allow yourself to sink into the silence between each impulse. let your attention return to its seat in your heart. --- the divine source is the cause of all and is ever present at heart. to accept natural human limitations and boundaries is the first step towards awareness of the boundless within us—our soul or spirit. we live within this mysterious reality where the transient and the eternal are inseparable. to explain this situation is the origin of most religions. a wholesome mind has no option other than to accept the challenging gift of life and to try to interact with creation in smooth and natural ways, harmonious with body, mind and heart. the reflective person deals holistically with body, mind and soul. purity of heart is necessary for the soul’s light to reveal the map of reality. life and death are experienced in two zones, one biological and the other one spiritual, beyond the confines of space and time. for every outer there is an inner. all entities emerge from energy and are interconnected in the universe. discriminating between outer and inner is the first step to realizing their inseparability in essence. the challenge of life is to learn and read the maps of dualities and how all opposites balance and neutralize each other. what is real is original oneness—ever perfect. we are creatures between dense darkness and cosmic light. our median position gives us the advantage of witnessing reality in its fullness. all dualities have their root in the original oneness to which they return—the perpetual one. from the one, dualities and pluralities emerge, only to develop, mature and then subside back to oneness. the tree of life with its roots and trunk produces multiple branches and expressions. your soul is sacred in origin yet it remains in its present, temporary residence in your heart. be at its altar—worship and experience lights. we experience change and movement due to the stable nature of our soul. the nature of the soul is primal light and its purpose is to illumine the physical and mental components of humans. when you identify with your biography, ego, or lower self, you are doing yourself injustice. the soul radiates divine justice. the soul is beyond any changes that the self experiences. to live as a soul in the moment leads to experiencing the pure thrill of life. when you discover the bliss that emanates from your own soul, you are awakening to the divine promise. the beginner’s mind is fresh, flexible, and close to the door of eternal presence and the infinite nowness. the road sign to a city is not the city. remembrance is a sign. experiencing the light within is to be celebrated. we have all evolved from oneness and are driven to know and experience it through higher consciousness. reality is one and it manifests as countless entities within space and time, each carrying a reminder of the origin. the beginning of existence and its end is oneness. in between, we take delight in experiences of deep connectedness. connection and continuation are dominant in human consciousness —at all stages of life and existence. the ego serves its purpose by providing a cover for the sacred soul until one is ready for its light and presence. the human desire to know and understand everything is indicative of the potential within us that knows all. the wise realize that neither attraction nor repulsion bring durable contentment to the heart. the awakened being simply witnesses the changes and remains within the ever constant soul. we make allowance for our earthly limitations whilst evolving towards our origin—boundless life. the awakened being lives within sensible and wise limitations on earth whilst experiencing the limitless light of the soul within. most people complain that time flies, but the awakened ones discover the inner zone of timelessness. every human reflects the story of the universe. however, life itself has no beginning or end. the divine is eternal. the natural desire to change the world is a reflection of the need of self to yield and be transformed to soul. this outcome is greater than changing the world. personal awareness of life is the starting point of experiencing life in its infinite boundless reality. humanity is obsessed with its original nature—divinity and singularity. that is the root of all desires, passions and obsessions. each one of us contains aspects of animality, humanity and a spark of divinity. at best we may reflect an aspect of the real. the wise aspire to connectedness with a state that is constant, beautiful and perfect—the soul. the constant human challenge is to maintain the balance between our sensory world and the inner light of the soul. to be in balance physically, mentally, and spiritually, we need to listen and respond with healing affection. the purpose of human life is complete when total harmony between body, mind and heart is attained and experienced. our spiritual growth is landmarked by clear intentions, efficient action and regular contemplation. from hesitancy comes clarity. to find your real self —your soul— lose your identity and yield to the inner light of your soul. the soul carries the imprint of cosmic reality. self/soul interplay reveals the emergence of duality from unity. your soul is the most gentle as well as most powerful and tough. it is not subject to change. higher consciousness is our enduring nature and reality; and the closer we are to it the more we feel secure in its presence. the human journey in life is an ascent in consciousness from what we consider normal, towards the full spectrum—cosmic oneness. everyone strives to discover reality and be content. there are different levels of spiritual experiences all leading to inner stillness and pure witnessing. the state of constant presence is the nature of our soul, which is the source of our life. our life is totally entangled with the sacred cosmic oneness. all our earthly quests aim to experience this reality. a remedy may be bitter and a poison may be sweet. what may please your ego can darken the heart. the illusion of separation is a driving force toward the conclusion—universal oneness, perpetual singularity. to lead towards a balanced human destiny one needs to be a follower of the soul and its divine guidance at all times. to serve unconditionally is to liberate yourself from the calculating mind and ego. sustainable peace is the outcome if humans come closer to the peace of their own soul, and live in that state. human life is based upon connections with different threads of life. the original cause is one and the universe is the effect. physically we relate to our biological roots, spiritually to our original timeless reality: ever-present at heart. in essence, all ‘other’ human beings are the same as you. the paradox is that the human soul is both exclusive (you have it) and inclusive (everyone lives by it). when the self is in unison with the soul, all relationships fit in with ease and efficiency. the drive to experience unity and continuity needs the vehicle of the heart. love is a beam of the soul that penetrates a pure heart. all aspects of love emanate from the original divine love that connects and links the entire universe. reflection upon emotional states emanates from the soul, which illumines the journey towards its own perfection. the highest point of human love is life itself. love of life points towards the understanding of all intricate relationships as they manifest on earth or elsewhere. passion for life is love of its perpetual essence. similarities in mind and emotions are preludes to experiencing aspects of sameness and oneness—where eternal love ends all differences and separation. when you respect others as yourself, you are in close harmony to souls and their sameness. love for life is the root of all quests. the highest level of morality is to respond to the voice of truth, as it emanates from the pure heart. human life is a short bridge that leads to the experience of the eternal nature of one’s own soul. pleasure is accompanied by pain until we perceive existence through the lens of the soul—a steady state of euphoria. when self-love yields to the perfect soul within, then it is at one with the life force that pervades the universe. we occasionally experience the perfect moment—no thought, intention or action. that instant reveals our soul’s perfect state. all desires and quests end at the door of higher consciousness, at the point of the soul’s perfection. with awakening we follow the one and only optimum choice. the path of knowledge ends with the end of personal will or desire. the natural outcome of knowledge and guidance is the experience of sacred presence and its perfection. your soul reflects the sacred presence, yet your earthly side experiences life through change. the real you is eternal, but appears to change. in sacred presence belonging is a redundant word: there is only the light from which everything emanates and to which all returns. the present gives rise to all that is perceived within space and time—that is sacred presence! the perfect now. now is not caught within space or time, but simply gives rise to illusions of time. now represents eternal presence appearing in time. the moment, the now, is ever perpetual and to read it is to open the book of cosmic truth. the pattern and plan is well in place and our role is simply to follow the design. enjoy grace. divine love is the cosmic energy field that permeates the whole universe and manifests as the human soul within the heart—proof of god’s love. existence is an emanation of return from the one. the big question is who and where is god? if the answer is that there is only god, then who are you? even this question can only be posed by god’s grace. the light of supreme consciousness declares itself as the reason."

    "content": "encouraging heart “there are no valid arguments for the ‘existence’ of god, but there are acts of courage in which we affirm the power of being, whether we know it or not. if we know it, we accept acceptance consciously. if we do not know it, we nevertheless accept it and participate in it.” – paul tillich “though thou slay me, yet will i praise thee” – job 13:15 despair and joy i experience deep joy. i experience utter despair. why? why does a dharma talk about joy contain a story about a zen monk leading a home-made ceremony to help bereft parents wash the body of their boy who has just died of cancer? why does a kirtan singer stop chanting to tell stories about the guru whose passing broke his heart? why does honesty require courage? what is the nature of this courage? paul tillich writes that, “courage can show us what being is, and being can show us what courage is.” so, let us be together for a moment and see what we experience. > “joy is the emotional expression of the courageous yes to one’s own true being. this combination of courage and joy shows the ontological character of courage most clearly. if courage is interpreted in ethical terms alone, its relation to the joy of self-fulfillment remains hidden. in the ontological act of the self-affirmation of one’s essential being, courage and joy coincide.” before we’ve even begun, tillich tells us that courage is not only about ethics–that is, honesty and how to be–it is about ‘ontology’: that is, being-itself. the courage to stand up for the truth (or live honestly) is interdependent with the courage to be true (or truly be). the courage to be true–to say yes to life in a fundamental way–is expressed in daily life as joy. as tillich says, “the affirmation of one’s essential being in spite of desires and anxieties creates joy.” perhaps we experience joy because each one of us is born capable of affirming our true being, and we experience despair because none of us can share fully what or who is being affirmed? paradox “our only hope is the hope that appears when the situation is beyond hope.” – peter j gomes affirming our true being–what tillich calls self-affirmation–is the paradox of “participation in something which transcends the self”. this is possible because the neat split we often assume between subject and object has no inherent existence. we are participants in the mystery, just as we are each a unique expression of the mystery. tillich is carving out space enough to allow for the full expression of both these truths. he begins by emphasising the participative element, along with the paradoxical nature of the self being affirmed: > “perfect self-affirmation is not an isolated act which originates in the individual being but is participation in the universal or divine act of self-affirmation, which is the originating power in every individual act. in this idea the ontology of courage has reached its fundamental expression [...] an expression of the participation of the soul in divine self-love. the courage to be is possible because it is participation in the self-affirmation of being-itself.” what we affirm when we say yes to life is not the small self who seems to experience it, but the entire being in which we find ourselves enfolded. > “in every encounter with reality the structures of self and world are interdependently present. the most fundamental expression of this fact is the language which gives man the power to abstract and, after having abstracted, to return, to interpret and transform.” the total situation is the question to which your limited perception is called to respond. the language with which you choose to interpret this may transform the totality into something which can be shared. however, being limited, i cannot hope to respond with consequence unless i simultaneously participate in that which is greater than me while realising who i truly am. > “in doing all this the courageous self is united with life itself and its secret.” vitality how can i describe this notion of participating with that which is greater than myself, while simultaneously realising who i truly am? for a brief moment, tillich arrives at the african concept of ubuntu, writing, “only in the continuous encounter with other persons does the person become and remain a person.” there is a deep and revealing truth in this which goes to the heart of participation and individuation. however, we will explore a slightly different perspective here by together considering the term vitality: > “vitality is the power of creating beyond oneself without losing oneself.” > “a life process which shows this balance and–with it–power of being has, in biological terms, vitality, i.e. life power. the right courage therefore must, like the right fear, be understood as the expression of perfect vitality. the courage to be is a function of vitality.” the power of being is fundamentally balanced. this is why the ethical aspect of courage is equally important–interdependent with–the question of true being. it is not just courage: it is a specific kind of courage we seek, just as we recognise that there is healthy fear. in fact, this humbling recognition is precisely what grounds the courage required to face the terminal doubt of god and take meaninglessness fully into itself. to embody the courage that takes meaninglessness into itself, we need to first understand the dialectical nature of participation and begin thinking in terms of power instead of in terms of things. by ‘power’, i don’t mean the concept which corrupts, but the force and presence of life, of work done across time, energy exerted in relation to one another. taken in this sense, we can approach tillich’s increasingly loopy sentences: > “vitality, power of life, is correlated to the kind of life to which it gives power. “ that is, you can choose to live a revitalising life or not. the power by, with, and within which you live can be amplified or drained by how you live. this occurs by virtue of your intention, which just means your ‘relationship to meanings’ (what you intend to do is what you mean to happen). vitality, considered as the power of creating beyond oneself without losing oneself, allows us to realise the abiding bridge between matter and spirit: > “nothing is ‘merely biological’ as nothing is ‘merely spiritual.’ every cell of our body participates in our freedom and spirituality, and every act of our spiritual creativity is nourished by our vital dynamics.” anxiety “the courage to be is rooted in the god who appears when god has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.” in order to give a full description of courage, tillich recognises that he must describe its polarity: anxiety. courage, in his terms, is always “in spite of” and we have to know in spite of what if we are to understand both the ethical and ontological implications of his insights. ultimately, tillich is talking about the courage to be in spite of nonbeing. it is the constant and inescapable threat of nonbeing which makes being courageous. in tillich's framework, nonbeing can take either relative or absolute form in three different (but interdependent) ways: ontological, spiritual, and moral. 1. our ontological anxieties are fate (relative) and death (absolute) 2. our spiritual anxieties are doubt (relative) and meaninglessness (absolute) 3. our moral anxieties are guilt (relative) and condemnation (absolute) these are not pathologies: they are present in each of us. every age experiences and expresses these anxieties, though with a different emphasis. the expression of anxiety is especially prevalent at the end of each age. the end of antiquity is dominated by anxiety about fate and death. the end of the middle ages is dominated by anxiety about guilt and condemnation. and our own age is dominated by anxiety about doubt and meaninglessness. tillich makes a long survey of the many different responses philosophy, art, culture, and politics have given to these interrelated anxieties. he arrives at the realisation that neither participation nor individuation is enough to handle the triple burden of these anxieties which are part and parcel of being: > “courage needs the power of being, a power transcending the nonbeing which is experienced in the anxiety of fate and death, which is present in the anxiety of [doubt] and meaninglessness, which is effective in the anxiety of guilt and condemnation. the courage which takes this threefold anxiety into itself must be rooted in a power of being that is greater than the power of oneself and the power of one’s world. neither self-affirmation as a part nor self-affirmation as oneself is beyond the manifold threat of nonbeing.” essentially, we are looking for one kind of courage, expressed in multiple ways: > “self-affirmation as a part requires as much courage as does self-affirmation as oneself. it is one courage which takes a double threat of nonbeing into itself. the courage to be is essentially always the courage to be as a part and the courage to be as oneself, in interdependence.” knowing this, tillich turns to two kinds of courage which epitomise either participation or individuation. these are (i) mystical participation in god, or (ii) personal encounter with god. > “as long as the absence of the power of being is felt as despair, it is the power of being which makes itself felt through despair. to experience this and to endure it is the courage to be of the mystic in the state of emptiness.” however encouraging it may be to know that this courage of despair can be embodied (and indeed has been embodied over and over again throughout the ages), tillich points out that: > “mysticism does not take seriously the concrete and the doubt concerning the concrete. it plunges directly into the ground of being and meaning, and leaves the concrete, the world of finite values and meanings, behind. therefore it does not solve the problem of meaninglessness. in terms of the present religious situation this means that eastern mysticism is not the solution of the problems of western existentialism, although many people attempt this solution.” so, perhaps it is in the individual’s personal encounter with the divine that salvation lies? > “the courage to affirm oneself in spite of the anxiety of condemnation is the courage which we have called the courage of confidence. it is rooted in the personal, total, and immediate certainty of divine forgiveness.” yet this personal encounter is also insufficient. its emphasis in culture led not only to fascism and nazism, but also to a destructive existentialism in our time. tillich doesn’t demean the existential perspective–often illustrating its roots in various aspects of theology–but he uses it to illustrate the shortcomings of elevating personal encounter above all else. ultimately, having analysed both the courage to be as a part and the courage to be as oneself, tillich comes to a uniquely integrative insight: > “if participation is dominant, the relation to being-itself has a mystical character, if individualization prevails the relation to being-itself has a personal character, if both poles are accepted and transcended the relation to being-itself has the character of faith.” faith “without a consciousness of truth itself, doubt of truth would be impossible.” what is this faith which integrates participation and individuation? we have explored its elements above, so let us simply gather them together now. this singular faith consists of dual aspects tillich variously calls: 1. the courage to be as a part, the courage of despair, or the courage of wisdom. >“socrates is certain that the self which the executioners will destroy is not the self which affirms itself in his courage to be.” > “the courage to die is the test of the courage to be. a self-affirmation which omits taking the affirmation of one’s death into itself tries to escape the test of courage, the facing of nonbeing in the most radical way.” 2. the courage to be as oneself, the courage of confidence, or the courage to accept forgiveness. > “one could say that the courage to be is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable.” > “the encounter with god in luther [...] means encountering transcendent security and transcendent eternity. who [encounters] god participates in eternity [but you] must be accepted by god and you must have accepted god’s acceptance of you.” these two aspects of courage are united when you stop trying to grasp them, and instead let yourself be grasped by them. > “to be grasped by this power is to be able to affirm yourself because you know that you are affirmed by the power of being-itself. in this point mystical experience and personal encounter are identical.” they are identical, because both mystical participation in and personal encounter with god are what is meant by ‘grace’. importantly, “courage as grace is a result and a question”: the result being union and the question being if we can continuously accept what seems unacceptable. result and question together encourage us to respond whole-heartedly in each moment, just like those who have walked these ways before us: > “living itself means nothing other than being questioned; our whole act of being is nothing more than responding to—of being responsible toward—life. with this mental standpoint nothing can scare us any more, no future, no apparent lack of a future. because now the present is everything as it holds the eternally new question of life for us.” – viktor frankl such response-ability takes us into the ongoing, integrative, living experience which tillich is pointing to between all this symbolic language: > “the courage to be which is rooted in the experience of the god above god unites and transcends the courage to be as a part and the courage to be as oneself. it avoids both the loss of oneself by participation and the loss of one’s world by individualization.” lost and found “the courage to be in its radical form is a key to an idea of god which transcends both mysticism and the person-to-person encounter.” having described how the courage to be can manifest, and how we can allow ourselves to be grasped by it such that we participate fully as unique beings in the power of being-itself, tillich finally turns to the question relevant to our particular neighbourhood of space-time: > “can faith resist meaninglessness? is there a kind of faith which can exist together with doubt and meaninglessness?” in this, we are asking–along with tillich–about the > “ultimate foundation of what we have called the ‘courage of despair.’ there is only one possible answer, if one does not try to escape the question: namely that the acceptance of despair is in itself faith and on the boundary line of the courage to be.” > “the faith which makes the courage of despair possible is the acceptance of the power of being, even in the grip of nonbeing. even in the despair about meaning being affirms itself through us.” > “the act of accepting meaninglessness is in itself a meaningful act [...] the vitality that can stand the abyss of meaninglessness is aware of a hidden meaning within the destruction of meaning.” in these profoundly circular statements, we who have the courage to look into the abyss of our own anxiety and be grasped by it, may just glimpse the empty form which has always represented creation for those courageous enough to ask, “what is here? why now?” > “this faith transcends both the mystical experience and the divine-human encounter. the mystical experience seems to be nearer to absolute faith but it is not. absolute faith includes an element of skepticism which one cannot find in the mystical experience.” > “the content of absolute faith is the ‘god above god.’ absolute faith and its consequence, the courage that takes the radical doubt, the doubt about god, into itself, transcends the idea of god.” > “absolute faith is the accepting of the acceptance without somebody or something that accepts.” > “absolute faith, or the state of being grasped by the god beyond god, is not a state which appears beside other states of the mind. it never is something separated and definite, an event which could be isolated and described. it is always a movement in, with, and under other states of the mind. it is the situation on the boundary of man’s possibilities. it is this boundary.” > “therefore it is both the courage of despair and the courage in and above every courage. it is not a place where one can live, it is without the safety of words and concepts, it is without a name, a church, a cult, a theology. but it is moving in the depth of all of them.” such a courageous faith is embodied by the “crucified who cried to god who remained god after the god of confidence had left them in the darkness of doubt and meaninglessness”. a marvelous translation since writing this piece, i have discovered that this cry of the crucified is really a mistranslation, despite the beautiful (and nevertheless true) point tillich is able to draw from it. this is from neil douglas klotz: > “and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, my god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?” (mark 15:34, kjv) > el el lamana shbwaqtuni (aramaic of what jesus says). > here we find one of the most troublesome of yeshua's reported sayings. if it were the divine will for him to be crucified, and so presumably also his own will, why would he feel “forsaken?” the simple answer is he didn't. we are looking at a mistranslation here. > as you can see from the above, the word translated “forsaken” (shbwaqtuni) is another form of the same word we found in the sixth line of yeshua's prayer, meaning to release or untie. the aramaic lamana does not pose a question but is better rendered by “for such a purpose.” > the early twentieth century assyrian aramaic christian scholar george lamsa says this word introduces an exclamation like “what a thing!” rather than posing a question.⁹ lamsa further points out that aramaic has two words that can mean “forsake” or “forget” but that yeshua uses neither of them here.¹⁰ > yeshua was misunderstood at the time, but in a different way than the above mistranslation does. this is reinforced by the following passage: > “and some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, behold, he calleth elias [elijah].” (mark 15:35, kjv) > no one comments that he is feeling forsaken. instead, yeshua is saying something like: > o alaha, what a wonder—this is the purpose for which i was spared and released! it is not a forsaken cry. it is the epitome of what tillich calls absolute faith. it is the situation on the boundary of man’s possibilities. it is this boundary, and the embodied realisation that its acceptance is its release and our redemption. this redemption occurs in time, but is not of time: a point most wonderfully made by friar richard rohr."

    "content": "pearls metaphor is the ultimate transformational grammar. it comes from the greek word \"meta\", meaning 'beyond' and \"pherein\", meaning to transfer or carry. it is the linguistic structure that carries meaning beyond what language is meant to hold. that said, in certain contexts, \"meta\" can also mean 'with' or 'among'. that is, rather than beyond, it could mean something more like 'between'. what, then, is the final metaphor; the last transformational linguistic bridge which will bear us beyond into a peace between any particular understanding? historical answers include god, allah, jahweh, allaha, om, or dao. however, all of these words simply point at the unnameable essence which grounds all language, meaning, music, and being. properly speaking, such words are not metaphors: they are the ultimate negation of metaphor. they reveal only the insufficiency of words and notes; our inability to ever say or play what truly is. the totality cannot be told. why say anything then? if our metaphors - no matter how beautiful or how close they might come to truth - will always be negated by this featureless \"black hole\" which is the foundation of the house of god, what is the point of any speech? well, for me, this points at the very heart of the ambiguity which is called human spirit; this holy breath which holds us. here is that last metaphor we're looking for: soul. the light bridge between us and a love so full in itself it gives us life. the soul is that which turns this all-too-human moment towards divine presence. it is the eternal and permanent essence before, after, within and beyond each of our transient and preciously fragile lives. it moves us, this final metaphor, towards the stillness in which all under heaven rests."

    "content": "true victory all my time spent, no time at all lost, in singularity: this many-folded matrix, clear manifest of every message. what touched one heart is traced here. if it turns you read the whole book yourself. you have been warned. all this really is: a record of my flaws, for which i am responsible. --- visankharagatam cittam &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone to dissolution is the mind, tanhanam khayam ajjhaga &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cravings have come to an end. please complete wudu before reading this. alternatively, stop here, close your eyes and focus on your breath. allow yourself to sink into the silence between each impulse. let your attention return to its seat in your heart. one word about the name \"allah\". al is the definite article in arabic, meaning 'the'. lah is senseless: it has no meaning. it is, in some fundamental manner, the empty-form-formless-emptiness found in the heart sutra; the word that is god in the gospel of john; the being that appears to the gods in the kena upanishad, whom uma - divine wisdom - calls \"tadvanam\". when we say \"allahu akhbar\", we are saying \"god is greater\". not great (a thing) or greatest (a degree of comparison), but greater. always greater than anything you can think or imagine; neither empty nor formless (nor both, nor neither); a word without tense that is the source of time; that which is adored above any thing and annihilates the longing of true love. this is not to elide the important historical distinctions between these traditions, to obscure the differences in their practice, or to ignore the impact (positive and negative) they continue to have on people. that said, and as sri krishna prem writes about the simple path by which we unify our finitude with infinite being: > \"it is not so much a synthesis of these separate teachings as that prior and undivided whole of which they represent partial formulations.\" --- declaration 40:44 \"you will soon remember what i say (now), my (own) affair i commit to allah: for allah (ever) watches over his servants.\" 3:84 say: \"we believe in allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to moses, jesus, and other prophets from their lord—we make no distinction between any of them, and to him we fully submit.\" 21:105 before this we wrote in the psalms, after the message (given to moses): “my servants, the righteous, shall inherit the earth.” 21:93 (see also 23:52-3) but (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another: (yet) they will all return to us. 6:155-6 and this is a book which we have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that you may receive mercy: lest you should say: \"the book was sent down to two peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:\" 26:192-3 verily this is a revelation from the lord of the worlds: with it came down the spirit of faith and truth- 56:80-1 a revelation from the lord of the worlds. is it such a message that you would hold in light esteem? 3:126 allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from allah. the exalted, the wise: 73:5 surely we will make to light upon you a weighty word. 86:13 behold this is the word that distinguishes (good from evil): 50:16 it was we who created man, and we know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for we are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein. 51:5 verily that which you are promised is true; 3:60 the truth (comes) from allah alone; so be not of those who doubt. 10:36 but most of them follow nothing but fancy: truly fancy can be of no avail against truth. verily allah is well aware of all that they do. 10:53 they seek to be informed by you: \"is that true?\" say: \"yes! by my lord! it is the very truth! and you cannot frustrate it!\" 15:64 \"we have brought to you that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tell the truth. 45:29 \"this our record speaks about you with truth: for we were wont to put on record all that you did.\" 8:8 that he might justify truth and prove falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt. 3:3 he has revealed to thee the book in truth, confirming what came before it, as he revealed the torah and the gospel. 3:7 he it is who has sent down to thee the book: in it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the book: others are allegorical. but those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except allah. those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \"we believe in the book; the whole of it is from our lord.\" none will grasp the message except men of understanding. 3:137 many were the ways of life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected truth. 41:53 soon will we show them our signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the truth. is it not enough that thy lord is a witness of all things? 55:13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77 (see also 53:55) then which of the favors of your lord will you deny? 31:22 whoever submits his whole self to allah, and is a doer of good, has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with allah rests the end and decision of (all) affairs. 7:81 and say: \"truth has (now) arrived, and falsehood perished: for falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish.\" 7:118 thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. 2:256 let there be no compulsion in religion: truth stands out clear from error: whoever rejects evil and believes in allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. and allah heareth and knoweth all things. 4:26 it is allah’s will to make things clear to you, guide you to the noble ways of those before you, and turn to you in mercy. for allah is all-knowing, all-wise 4:174 o mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your lord: for we have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest. 54:17, 22, 32, 40 and we have indeed made the qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? 24:18 and allah makes the signs plain to you: for allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. 31:30 that is because allah is the (only) reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides him is falsehood; and because allah,- he is the most high, most great. 22:62 that is because allah - he is the reality; and those besides him whom they invoke,- they are but vain falsehood: verily allah is he, most high, most great. 16:22 your allah is one allah: as to those who believe not in the hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant. 21:30 do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? we made from water every living thing. will they not then believe? 15:85 we created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. and the hour is surely coming (when this will be manifest). so overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness. 44:59 the hour will certainly come: therein is no doubt: yet most men believe not. 67:25-6 they ask: when will this promise be (fulfilled)? - if you are telling the truth. say: \"as to the knowledge of the time, it is with allah alone: i am (sent) only to warn plainly in public.\" 70:6-7 they see the (day) indeed as a far-off (event): but we see it (quite) near. 6:67 for every message is a limit of time, and soon shall you know it. 21:1 closer and closer to mankind comes their reckoning: yet they heed not and they turn away. 31:28 and your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for allah is he who hears and sees (all things). 56:62 and you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember? always you 45:15 whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against himself. in the end, you shall be brought back to your lord. 7:7 then we will give them a full account with sure knowledge—for we were never absent. 20:46 he said: \"fear not: for i am with you: i hear and see (everything). 20:41 \"and i have prepared thee for myself (for service)\" 84:6 o thou man! verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy lord- painfully toiling,- but thou shalt meet him. 29:6 and if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for allah is free of all needs from all creation. 14:34 and he giveth you all that you ask for. but if you count the favours of allah, never will you be able to number them. verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude. 53:36-9 nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the books of moses- and of abraham who fulfilled his engagements?- namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another; that man can have nothing but what he strives for; 30:44 those who reject faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will spread their couch (of repose) for themselves (in heaven): 23:62 on no soul do we place a burden greater than it can bear: before us is a record which clearly shows the truth: they will never be wronged. 10:44 verily allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: it is man that wrongs his own soul. 8:53 \"because allah will never change the grace which he hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily allah is he who heareth and knoweth (all things).\" 54:52-3 (see also 6:38 and 6:59) all that they do is noted in (their) books (of deeds): every matter, small and great, is on record. 17:14 read your book. let your own self suffice you now as accountant. 22:77 o you who believe! bow down, prostrate yourselves, and adore your lord; and do good; that you may prosper. 7:206 those who are near to thy lord, disdain not to do him worship: they celebrate his praises, and prostrate before him. 31:33 o mankind! do your duty to your lord, and fear (the coming of) a day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father. verily, the promise of allah is true: let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about allah. 39:49 now, when trouble touches man, he cries to us: but when we bestow a favour upon him as from ourselves, he says, \"this has been given to me because of a certain knowledge (i have)!\" nay, this is a trial, but most of them understand not! 39:70 and to every soul will be paid in full (the fruit) of its deeds; and (allah) knoweth best all that they do. 65:7 let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what allah has given him. allah puts no burden on any person beyond what he has given him. after a difficulty, allah will soon grant relief. 7:42 but those who believe and work righteousness,- no burden do we place on any soul, but that which it can bear,- they will be companions of the garden, therein to dwell (for ever). 2:138 this is the natural way of allah. and who is better than allah in ordaining a way? and we worship none but him. 2:242 thus doth allah make clear his signs to you: in order that ye may understand. 7:52 for we had certainly sent unto them a book, based on knowledge, which we explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe. 57:29 that the people of the book may know that they have no power whatever over the grace of allah, that (his) grace is (entirely) in his hand, to bestow it on whomsoever he wills. for allah is the lord of grace abounding. 80:12 therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance. 10:32 such is allah, your real cherisher and sustainer: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? how then are you turned away? heartfelt sincerity 98:5 and they have been commanded no more than this: to worship allah, offering him sincere devotion, being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer; and to practise regular charity; and that is the way right and straight. 3:92 by no means shall you attain righteousness unless you give (freely) of that which you love; and whatever you give, truly allah knows it well. 50:37 verily in this is a message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth). 39:2 verily it is we who have revealed the book to thee in truth: so serve allah, offering him sincere devotion. 10:57 o mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a mercy. 8:10 allah made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from allah: and allah is exalted in power, wise. 33:4 allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body... 2:225 allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and he is oft-forgiving, most forbearing. 48:4 it is he who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers, that they may add faith to their faith;- for to allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth; and allah is full of knowledge and wisdom;- 50:33 who feared (allah) most gracious unseen, and brought a heart turned in devotion (to him): 26:89 but only he (will prosper) that brings to allah a sound heart; 35:38 verily allah knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily he has full knowledge of all that is in (men's) hearts. 57:23 we let you know this so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what he has granted you. for allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful— 73:8-10 but keep in remembrance the name of thy lord and devote thyself to him whole-heartedly. (he is) lord of the east and the west: there is no god but he: take him therefore for (thy) disposer of affairs. and have patience with what they say, and leave them with noble (dignity). 29:59 those who persevere in patience, and put their trust in their lord and cherisher. 37:40-1 the sincere (and devoted) servants of allah,- for them is a sustenance determined, 51:58 for allah is he who gives (all) sustenance,- lord of power,- steadfast (for ever). 94:5-8 so, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief: verily, with every difficulty there is relief. so once you have fulfilled your duty, strive in devotion, turning to your lord alone with hope. 17:94 what kept men back from belief when guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, \"has allah sent a man (like us) to be (his) messenger?\" 19:47 abraham said: \"peace be on thee: i will pray to my lord for thy forgiveness: for he is to me most gracious. 6:79 \"for me, i have set my face, firmly and truly, towards him who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall i give partners to allah.\" 40:27 moses said: \"i have indeed called upon my lord and your lord (for protection) from every arrogant one who believes not in the day of account!\" 40:66 say: \"i have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides allah,- seeing that the clear signs have come to me from my lord; and i have been commanded to bow (in islam) to the lord of the worlds.\" 27:40 said one who had knowledge of the book: \"i will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!\" then when (solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: \"this is by the grace of my lord!- to test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my lord is free of all needs, supreme in honour!\" 12:111 there is, in their stories, instruction for men endowed with understanding. it is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe. 11:120 all that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it we make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. 18:27 and recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the book of thy lord: none can change his words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than him. 29:45 recite what is sent of the book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular prayer: for prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. and allah knows the (deeds) that you do. 29:49 nay, here are signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject our signs. 7:172 and remember when your lord brought forth from the loins of the children of adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. allah asked, “am i not your lord?” they replied, “yes, you are! we testify.” he cautioned, “now you have no right to say on judgment day, ‘we were not aware of this.’” 13:28 those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of allah do hearts find satisfaction. 24:37 by men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the remembrance of allah, nor from regular prayer, nor from the practice of regular charity: their (only) fear is for the day when hearts and eyes will be transformed (in a world wholly new),- 19:96 on those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (allah) most gracious bestow love. 67:13 and whether you hide your word or publish it, he certainly has (full) knowledge of the secrets of (all) hearts. 3:139 so lose not heart, nor fall into despair: for you must gain mastery if you are true in faith. mastery 67:1-2 blessed be he in whose hands is dominion; and he over all things hath power;- he who created death and life, that he may try which of you is best in deed: and he is the exalted in might, oft-forgiving;- 6:12 say: \"to whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?\" say: \"to allah. he hath inscribed for himself (the rule of) mercy. that he will gather you together for the day of judgment, there is no doubt whatever. it is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe.\" 27:26 \"allah!- there is no god but he!- lord of the throne supreme!\" 54:50 and our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye. 57:3 he is the first and the last, the evident and the immanent: and he has full knowledge of all things. 22:6-7 this is so, because allah is the reality: it is he who gives life to the dead, and it is he who has power over all things. and verily the hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about (the fact) that allah will raise up all who are in the graves. 20:111 (all) faces shall be humbled before (him) - the living, the self-subsisting, eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity (on his back). 20:114 high above all is allah, the king, the truth! be not in haste with the qur'an before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, \"o my lord! advance me in knowledge.\" 40:15-6 raised high above ranks (or degrees), (he is) the lord of the throne (of authority): by his command doth he send the spirit (of inspiration) to any of his servants he pleases, that it may warn of the day of mutual meeting,- the day whereon they will (all) come forth: not a single thing concerning them is hidden from allah. “whose will be the dominion that day?\" that of allah, the one, the irresistible! 15:98-9 celebrate the praises of thy lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration. and serve thy lord until there come unto thee the hour that is certain. 10:56 it is he who giveth life and who taketh it, and to him shall ye all be brought back. 39:44 say: \"to allah belongs exclusively (the right to grant) intercession: to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: in the end, it is to him that you shall be brought back.\" 39:62 allah is the creator of all things, and he is the guardian and disposer of all affairs. 4:126 but to allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: and he it is that encompasseth all things. 30:26 to him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to him. 3:109 to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: to him do all questions go back (for decision). 24:42 yea, to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and to allah is the final goal (of all). 2:284 to allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it, allah calleth you to account for it. he forgiveth whom he pleaseth, and punisheth whom he pleaseth, for allah hath power over all things. 13:39 allah doth blot out or confirm what he pleaseth: with him is the mother of the book. 10:37 this qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the book - wherein there is no doubt - from the lord of the worlds. 85:21-22 in fact, this is a glorious quran, recorded in a preserved tablet. 59:21 had we sent down this qur'an on a mountain, verily, thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of allah. such are the similitudes which we propound to men, that they may reflect. 27:88 thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of allah, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with all that you do. 56:75-6 furthermore i call to witness the setting of the stars,- and that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,- 14:24 seest thou not how allah sets forth a parable? a goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the heavens of its lord. so allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. 31:27 and if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean (were ink), with seven oceans behind it to add to its (supply), yet would not the words of allah be exhausted (in the writing): for allah is exalted in power, full of wisdom. 6:102-5 that is allah, your lord! there is no god but he, the creator of all things: then worship ye him: and he hath power to dispose of all affairs. no vision can grasp him, but his grasp is over all vision: he is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things. \"now have come to you, from your lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): i am not (here) to watch over your doings.\" thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say, \"thou hast taught (us) diligently,\" and that we may make the matter clear to those who know. 7:204 when the qur'an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that you may receive mercy. 15:9 we have, without doubt, sent down the message; and we will assuredly guard it (from corruption). 50:4 we already know how much of them the earth takes away: with us is a record guarding (the full account). 20:8 allah! there is no god but he! to him belong the most beautiful names. 20:98 the god of you all is the one allah: there is no god but he: all things he comprehends in his knowledge. 45:20 these are clear evidences to men and a guidance and mercy to those of assured faith. 42:17 it is allah who has sent down the book in truth, and the balance (by which to weigh conduct). and what will make thee realise that perhaps the hour is close at hand? 21:47 we shall set up scales of justice for the day of judgment, so that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be (no more than) the weight of a mustard seed, we will bring it (to account): and enough are we to take account. 55:7-8 and the firmament has he raised high, and he has set up the balance (of justice), in order that ye may not transgress (due) balance. 41:43 nothing is said to thee that was not said to the messengers before thee: that thy lord has at his command (all) forgiveness as well as a most grievous penalty. 39:67 no just estimate have they made of allah, such as is due to him: on the day of judgment the whole of the earth will be but his handful, and the heavens will be rolled up in his right hand: glory to him! high is he above the partners they attribute to him! 62:1 whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth constantly glorifies allah—the king, the most holy, the almighty, the all-wise. 3:51 \"it is allah who is my lord and your lord; then worship him. this is a way that is straight.” 3:83 do they desire a way other than allah’s—knowing that all those in the heavens and the earth submit to his will, willingly or unwillingly, and to him they will all be returned? 52:48 now await in patience the command of thy lord: for verily thou art in our eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy lord the while thou standest forth, live in death 39:30 truly thou wilt die (one day), and truly they (too) will die (one day). 29:19 see they not how allah originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for allah. 6:98 it is he who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: we detail our signs for people who understand. 6:162 say: \"truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for allah, the cherisher of the worlds: 53:25 it is to allah that the end and the beginning (of all things) belong. 3:9 \"our lord! thou art he that will gather mankind together against a day about which there is no doubt; for allah never fails in his promise.\" 3:145 nor can a soul die except by allah's leave, the term being fixed as by writing. if any do desire a reward in this life, we shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the hereafter, we shall give it to him. and swiftly shall we reward those that (serve us with) gratitude. 62:8 say: \"the death from which you flee will truly overtake you: then will you be sent back to the knower of things secret and open: and he will tell you (the truth of) the things that you did!\" 50:19 and the stupor of death will bring truth (before his eyes): \"this was the thing which thou wast trying to escape!\" 21:13 flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you, and to your homes in order that you may be called to account. 77:24-6 ah woe, that day! to the rejecters of truth! have we not made the earth (as a place) to draw together. the living and the dead, 29:57 every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to us shall ye be brought back. 29:64 what is the life of this world but amusement and play? but verily the home in the hereafter,- that is life indeed, if they but knew. 40:39 \"o my people! this life of the present is nothing but (temporary) convenience: it is the hereafter that is the home that will last.” 3:185 every soul shall have a taste of death: and only on the day of judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. only he who is saved far from the fire and admitted to the garden will have attained the object (of life): for the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. 30:19 it is he who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall ye be brought out (from the dead). 44:8 there is no god but he: it is he who gives life and gives death,- the lord and cherisher to you and your earliest ancestors. 24:25 on that day allah will pay them back (all) their just dues, and they will realise that allah is the (very) truth, that makes all things manifest. 24:41 seest thou not that it is allah whose praises all beings in the heavens and on earth do celebrate, and the birds (of the air) with wings outspread? each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise. and allah knows well all that they do. 4:78 \"wherever you are, death will find you out, even if you are in towers built up strong and high!\" if some good befalls them, they say, \"this is from allah\"; but if evil, they say, \"this is from thee\" (o prophet). say: \"all things are from allah.\" but what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? 6:94 \"and behold! you come to us bare and alone as we created you for the first time: you have left behind you all (the favours) which we bestowed on you: we see not with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!\" 16:96 what is with you must vanish: what is with allah will endure. and we will certainly bestow, on those who patiently persevere, their reward according to the best of their actions. 10:16 say: \"if allah had so willed, i should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would he have made it known to you. a whole life-time before this have i tarried amongst you: will you not then understand?\" 10:108 say: \"o people! now truth hath reached you from your lord! those who receive guidance, do so for the good of their own souls; those who stray, do so to their own loss: and i am not (set) over you to arrange your affairs.\" 50:43 verily it is we who give life and death; and to us is the final goal- 40:68 it is he who gives life and death; and when he decides upon an affair, he says to it, \"be\", and it is. 28:88 and call not, besides allah, on another god. there is no god but he. everything (that exists) will perish except his own face. to him belongs the command, and to him will ye (all) be brought back. 9:27 again will allah, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom he will: for allah is oft-forgiving, most merciful. fulfilment 6:115 the word of thy lord finds its fulfilment in truth and in justice: none can change his words: for he is the one who heareth and knoweth all. 48:1 verily we have granted thee a manifest victory: 21:104 the day that we roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books (completed),- even as we produced the first creation, so shall we produce a new one: a promise we have undertaken: truly shall we fulfil it. 6:45 of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. praise be to allah, the cherisher of the worlds. 50:32 (a voice will say:) \"this is what was promised for you,- for every one who turned (to allah) in sincere repentance, who kept (his law), 17:108 \"and they say: 'glory to our lord! truly has the promise of our lord been fulfilled!'\" 37:180-2 glory to thy lord, the lord of honour and power! (he is free) from what they ascribe (to him)! and peace on the messengers! and praise to allah, the lord and cherisher of the worlds. 40:2-3 the revelation of this book is from allah, exalted in power, full of knowledge,- who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is strict in punishment, and hath a long reach (in all things). there is no god but he: to him is the final goal. 40:65 he is the living (one): there is no god but he: call upon him, giving him sincere devotion. praise be to allah, lord of the worlds! 23:1 the believers must (eventually) win through,- 110:1 when comes the help of allah, and victory, 10:4 to him is your return all together. allah’s promise is always true. indeed, he originates the creation then resurrects it so that he may justly reward those who believe and do good. but those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief. 3:198 on the other hand, for those who fear their lord, are gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of allah; and that which is in the presence of allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. 39:34 they shall have all that they wish for, in the presence of their lord: such is the reward of those who do good: 6:2 he it is who created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). and there is in his presence another determined term; yet you doubt within yourselves! 50:35 there will be for them therein all that they wish,- and more besides in our presence. 44:5 by command, from our presence. for we (ever) send (revelations), 4:40 allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), he doubleth it, and giveth from his own presence a great reward. 9:22 they will dwell therein for ever. verily in allah's presence is a reward, the greatest (of all). 9:111 allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of paradise): they fight in his cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on him in truth, through the law, the gospel, and the qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than allah? then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded: that is the achievement supreme. 57:12 one day shalt thou see the believing men and the believing women- how their light runs forward before them and by their right hands: (their greeting will be): \"good news for you this day! gardens beneath which flow rivers! to dwell therein for aye! this is indeed the highest achievement!\" 4:13 those are limits set by allah: those who obey allah and his messenger will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement. 37:60 verily this is the supreme achievement! 33:71 that he may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: he that obeys allah and his messenger, has already attained the highest achievement. 10:62 behold! verily on the friends of allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve; 10:64 for them are glad tidings, in the life of the present and in the hereafter; no change can there be in the words of allah. this is indeed the supreme felicity. 48:27 truly did allah fulfil the vision for his messenger: you shall enter the sacred mosque, if allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. for he knew what you knew not, and he granted, besides this, a speedy victory. 77:7 assuredly, what ye are promised must come to pass. 4:87 allah! there is no god but he: of a surety he will gather you together against the day of judgment, about which there is no doubt. and whose word can be truer than allah's? 30:6 (it is) the promise of allah. never does allah depart from his promise: but most men understand not. 16:1 (inevitable) cometh (to pass) the command of allah: seek ye not then to hasten it: glory to him, and far is he above having the partners they ascribe unto him! 40:55 patiently, then, persevere: for the promise of allah is true: and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and celebrate the praises of thy lord in the evening and in the morning. 78:4-5 verily, they shall soon (come to) know! verily, verily they shall soon (come to) know! 78:39 that day will be the sure reality: therefore, whoso will, let him take a (straight) return to his lord! 32:7 he who has made everything which he has created most good: he began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay, 69:1 the sure reality! 69:51 but verily it is truth of assured certainty. 51:23 then, by the lord of heaven and earth, this is the very truth, as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other. 3:61 this is the true account: there is no god except allah; and allah-he is indeed the exalted in power, the wise. 23:116 therefore exalted be allah, the king, the reality: there is no god but he, the lord of the throne of honour! peace 3:138 here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear allah! 51:22-24 allah is he, than whom there is no other god;- who knows (all things) both secret and open; he, most gracious, most merciful. allah is he, than whom there is no other god;- the sovereign, the holy one, the source of peace (and perfection), the guardian of faith, the preserver of safety, the exalted in might, the irresistible, the supreme: glory to allah! (high is he) above the partners they attribute to him. he is allah, the creator, the evolver, the bestower of forms (or colours). to him belong the most beautiful names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, declares his praises and glory: and he is the exalted in might, the wise. 56:95-96 verily, this is the very truth and certainty. so celebrate with praises the name of thy lord, the supreme. 19:93 not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (allah) most gracious as a servant. 21:19 to him belong all (creatures) in the heavens and on earth: even those who are in his (very) presence are not too proud to serve him, nor are they (ever) weary (of his service): 2:152 then do ye remember me; i will remember you. be grateful to me, and reject not faith. 19:36 verily allah is my lord and your lord: him therefore serve ye: this is a way that is straight. 19:40 it is we who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to us will they all be returned. 70:5 therefore do thou hold patience,- a patience of beautiful (contentment). 89:27-30 (to the righteous soul will be said:) \"o (thou) soul, in (complete) rest and satisfaction! \"come back thou to thy lord,- well pleased (thyself), and well-pleasing unto him! \"enter thou, then, among my devotees! \"yea, enter thou my heaven! 41:32 \"a hospitable gift from one oft-forgiving, most merciful!\" 10:10 (this will be) their cry therein: \"glory to thee, o allah!\" and \"peace\" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: \"praise be to allah, the cherisher and sustainer of the worlds!\" 10:25 but allah doth call to the home of peace: he doth guide whom he pleaseth to a way that is straight. 6:127 for them will be a home of peace in the presence of their lord: he will be their friend, because they practised (righteousness). 50:34 \"enter ye therein in peace and security; this is a day of eternal life!\" 18:3 wherein they shall remain for ever: 56:26 only the saying, \"peace! peace\"."
